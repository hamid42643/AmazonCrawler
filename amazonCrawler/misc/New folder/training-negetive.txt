"We gave this to my daughter for Christmas, but here we are \-\- in mid March and the camera is broken.  Didn\'t even last 4 months.  We\'re so disappointed, as is she.  Received lens error, now massive clicking sounds.  This one is a mess.  Wouldn\'t recommend.", negetive
"My Canon Powershot camera was \$59. I needed a cheap camera fast and I got mine within two days. The charger plugged directly into the wall with a place for the battery to sit. So far so good. But unlike all other cameras I have bought, it did not even come with a starter memory card. When I took a picture, it told me \"Cannot Record.\"  And there was no USB cable to connect to my computer either. That\'s a new one for me too.I repeat there is no memory card and no USB cord, so you can neither take a picture nor view it.But it did say in the book that there was a \"\*power cord,\"\(asterisk included\) written in smaller font on the starter page under Package Contents. But there was no such thing. Then under the first step, \"Charging the Battery, \" it tells you to, \"Plug the power cord into the charger, then plug the other end into a power outlet.\" I was able to charge my battery without this power cord. It was only by using a powerful light that I could see that on the back of my battery charger was the model number inscribed as CB\-2LF, and I did not need this power charger. Such needless aggravation.I have a wee website in which I am Amazon affiliate and I was going to write a review. But it looks like that will have to wait until the add\-ons I ordered today come in. So much for trusting Amazon to give me the full low\-down. It should come with a huge caution sign for buyers, especially at this price. These things do add up. How can you make a price\/feature comparison if you have to calculate so many variables\? Furthermore, a camera at this price, might be  for a gift, and the gift recipient would be pretty bummed if they had to order additional items just to make the Canon Powershot A2500 work.The bigger problem will be when I get the memory card and the proper USB cord, what happens if I don\'t like the picture of the camera or how it functions\? Will the aftermarket companies allow me to send back their products and get a refund that includes the shipping cost\? It would have been so much more convenient for Canon to sell a complete package.I guess  learned my lesson. The product description on Amazon gave the features of the camera. But it did not list what came in the box. I should have read through each review and customer Q \& A to glean what was still needed to make this camera fully operable.If this were a car it would be missing its steering wheel, and other car stuff, which I can\'t think of the analogies, because I am so frustrated.But there are three nice things I can tell you\: The cherry red is easy to spot in a dark purse and it is very, very light weight. And one kind person on this site Ricky Lorda, answered my question about the USB from the ask customer section of this page, saying that it did come with a USB cord \(although as I mentioned, mine did not\), and that was very nice of him to give me his quick response.", negetive
"Very disappointed in customer service. The camera said it came with free SD card and free case but when I received it there was no SD card or case so I called and they said I was suppose to click on learn more and then check those items but it said it cost for those items so I didn\'t click on them cause I thought I was getting them free. When I called customer service said they could not send the SD card or case. Very misleading, I\'m a very good customer but that didn\'t matter. So I would not buy this item for that reason.", negetive
"I purchased this Canon based upon reviews found on the web.  I compared the picture quality by using 2 cameras taking the exact same picture at the exact same time then comparing the results.  The other camera was my Canon SX110 purchased in 2008.  I was looking for a \"better\" camera, more pixels, better resolution...  Not nearly as good and I wanted better.  I wouldn\'t recommend this for kids to use as a toy.", negetive
"Bought this camera during Thanksgiving. the product was shipped later than the agreed date ..the deal came with the case and 16gb card. I did not receive the card and case I was promised..I ordered this camera for the sd card offered for the low price....I could have purchased sony wx710 instead for the same price. very flimsy tooo...planning to return", negetive
"There was no memory card that fit it\! I went to Walmart to find it and it still doesn\'t work\!", negetive
"Pictures are blurry and unfocused when the zoom is used. If you use the flash there are big blotches in your picture. I\'m really sorry I bought this camera.", negetive
"I am suppose to get a case and a memory card with my order of the A2500. 16mp digital camera with 5x optical image stabilized", negetive
"It was cheap and not at all like my previous camera.  I returned it and will be ordering a different model  Customer service was great however.", negetive
"This camera is not user friendly. I had to keep resetting the date, the flash never stayed on which is a pain in the ass and it took 5\+ seconds for the shot to be taken. Too bad Kodak went of biz. I still prefer their easyshare camera.", negetive
"CRAP.  DEFECTIVE.  MISSING PARTS.  NOT GOOD AT ALL.  ALWAYS HAD CANON.  WILL RETHINK MY DECISION.  IN PROCESS OF SENDING IT BACK FOR MY RFUND.", negetive
"It appears to be a nice little camera. BUT, it comes with no USB cord, no memory card, AND NO MANUAL. You can download a 119 page manual from the Canon Web site.  If your tech challenged forget it. This was the first digital camera I ever purchased. When I opened the box there was no disc for my computer. I\'m not one to download info from a web site. So I decided to return it. In my case it would be best for me to go to a camera store and get personal  advice form a sales person.", negetive
"Purchased in late Sep 2013, on a trip in Jan, the lens motor jammed.  Now it doesnt focus. You can hear a  motor inside constantly trying to do something. OUt of focus now. Zooms in and out, but wont focus.Second cannon product that has broken on me. Will be my last. Amazon return said my window has closed. So guess I\'m out of luck.", negetive
"I bought this camera and it eats batteries like crazy.  I might be able to take 5 pictures and then it needs new batteries.  It should be rechargeable.", negetive
"The camera that I received does not work. The image is totally blurred on the screen, probably a CCD issue. It is useless.", negetive
"The low light capabilities are not good at all. The shutter speed lags significantly and if I were taking pictures of my little nephews or dormmates being silly, the pictures would all come out blurry. The turn\-on time was slower than expected. Half a second makes a big difference in my opinion. The camera took too long to focus and often times did not focus on the proper subject. I did only take shots in my dorm room, but the lights were on. Maybe if I took pictures in the daytime outdoors, the quality of the pictures would have been better.The color is a very nice red and it was very light and small, but it felt so cheap because of the plastic shell. I returned it and bought the Canon Elph 330, which I like a heck of a lot better.Would not recommend or buy again.", negetive
"It said it comes with a free case and 16g sd card, non of it came with it, was a plain simple lie by Amazon, anything I can do now\?", negetive
"This is a horrible product and when I called Canon support I was told \"Well we didn\'t sell it to you\" \!\!\!\?", negetive
"It takes nice pictures but I\'m a little disappointed that it doesn\'t have a timer for group photos. Good size. Needed to purchase memory card separate.", negetive
"Have not used it enough to really rate this product and I keep taking pictures of myself which is really weird.", negetive
"after waiting 7 days to receive my camera, there was no memory card or power cord inside and it was useless. if I know I would order memory card, but there was no mention to that in the description info \!\!", negetive
"Took this camera to Disneyland and it kept freezing and had lines going through it so the pictures didnt turn out very well. Really want to return.", negetive
"I was very disappointed with this purchase. I formerly had the A3300 which was definitely much better then the A2500. It shuts off if you don\'t take a picture right away, the image stabilization \(which is one of the reasons I purchased this camera\) is horrible the picture is always blurry or out of focus and the Auto feature is slow to pick up anything or won\'t change to the correct feature.I would not recommend this camera to anyone and wish that I had gotten a different camera.", negetive
"This is the worst camera I have ever purchased.  Regardless which setting is used, every picture ends up blurry \(even still shots\).", negetive
"This unit has never operated correctly.  after installing new batteries and different memory cards, it always came up with an error of no memory or memory full when these cards were brand new and never used.", negetive
"The three item package proved to be useful.  I am not able to check on photos I have taken only when I have attached it to my computer then I can see the photos.  I am working on that.  Nice and easy to handle.", negetive
"It was working fine at the beginning, but it\'s zoom lens pulled out and can\'t turn on the camera after that.I don\'t think I cannot fix it, and I did not buy the guarantee so I don\'t think I could get reimburse.", negetive
"Do not like camera...photos are not up to par from less expensive older one.  Will not use it again.  Will keep it strictly as emergency backup but not happy about it.", negetive
"I bough the PowerShot A2500 for my wife for Christmas and within 1 1\/2 months the LCD screen got all distorted.When I sent it in to Canon they tried to say that the camera was dropped. The camera was never mistreated and Canon refuses to honor the warranty.Don\'t ever buy a Canon product as their customer service is HORRIBLE.", negetive
"The first one I got was a DOA, there is no user\'s manual and no power cable \-\- instruction book says the power cable is included..", negetive
"Because the power cord wasn\'t included in the box. After charging, the camera, it didn\'t work. Returned for a full refund.", negetive
"What is the purpose of selling an item that doesn\'t work right out of the box\? I really have to buy an additional item just to be able to use this camera\? I wonder how long a car dealership would stay in business if after the sale, the customer was told they needed to buy the tires because it wasn\'t part of the original sale, THIS IS BS\!", negetive
"When I first received it and used it, it worked great.  I put it away for awhile and noticed it needed to be charged.  I will not charge.  Tried everything.  I purchased May 2013, went to use again in July 2013, and that\'s when I noticed it doesn\'t charge.  Maybe I received a lemon but it\'s too bad because the pictures turned out beautiful.  What a waste of good money\!", negetive
"I had the camera for about 6 months and it quit working.  I sent it back to Canon and they said my warranty is null and void because I bought it from Amazon.  I couldn\'t believe it\!  They don\'t warranty the largest retailer in the world\!  Also,  I left the Wausabi battery in the camera, so they could see it was charged.  My warranty was again null and void because I used a Wausabi battery recommended by Amazon.  They must really  hate Amazon\!", negetive
"I am very disappointed with the Canon company. We purchased this very same camera over a year ago, but we lost it in Italy. This version does not come with a memory card or the cable needed to download images.So cheap of Canon\!\!\! The camera does a great job of taking pictures. But that\'s all you get from this version.Our original purchase had lots of bells and whistles on the camera and all the required accessories. This version only let\'s you have normal or low format pictures. We did not purchase this from Amazon, but I do not expect that you would get the needed accessories where ever you decide to purchase this product.", negetive
"I bought this because I had a PowerShot and lost it.  No instruction booklet, just a piece of paper that unfolded.  The cord to attach to pc was not in the box so I used my old one.  Could not download pictures.  Camera kept shutting off.  This updated version is awful.", negetive
"NO instruction on how the camera works in box.  The battery base charger pulls right into wall very dangerous.  The camera seem cheap made.", negetive
"I\'m so embarrassed \- no memory card and gave as a present.  Now buying a memory card which changes the whole deal.. Cheep decision by cannon.  You suck", negetive
"I purchased this camera at Target in August, 2013 and was only able to use it for less than 6\-months before it malfunctioned.The camera will turn on \(or sometimes it won\'t\) and then after a moment, the screen fills with pink\/green horizontal lines and is completely frozen until I remove the battery and try again.Completely useless camera.My first and last Canon.I could not be more dissatisfied.Wish there was a 0 star rating.", negetive

"I am not sure why people are not finding this review helpful. If you want to buy it and find out it is cheap quality, that is up to you \!\!\! I am trying to save you the aggravation.I purchased a Canon PowerShot ELPH 110 HS for \$200 which has been flawless.  and I bought this for my Mom, who wanted a simple camera. As soon as we went to install the battery, we realized that the battery cover is not a proper fit, the quality is consistant with a cheaper camera, After two charges of the battery, which involves opening the plastic door, it started to break.  I sent it back.", negetive
"I researched this camera very carefully before ordering.Canon stated that it was compatible with Windows Vista.Well, it wasn\'t.Canon blamed it on MS Silverlight.I have never dealt with such a hostile, arrogant tech support.I thought that this would be plug and play like every other digital cameras I have purchased.One completely frustrating, waste of time experience.Grateful that Amazon made the return an easy experience.Even the Canon feedback e\-mail was awful and consistent with this poor experience.It got to 99\% and it wouldn\'t complete loading.My 1st and last Canon product\!", negetive
"I bought this camera thinking it\'s from Canon so it must be good.  I took it on an international vacation and most of the pictures came out blurry.  It takes a long time for the camera to take a picture and you basically \"lose the moment\" because the camera is so slow.  Its a good camera if you\'ll only take closeups indoor.  I\'m so disappointed that I took such a bad quality camera on my trip and now don\'t have good pictures.  Returned it\!", negetive
"Took less than 10 pictures then had lens disk error. Can turn the camera on, but the camera just shuts itself down again. The camera was bought as a present. A piece of junk. Very disappointed.", negetive
"This camera is not user friendly and it does not take good pictures. An average phone takes better picture than this camera. I wonder why so many people rated it so high.", negetive
"Not sure why it is so hard to buy a point and shoot that takes photos that are in focus. I returned this.  Amazon was great about the return and even paid for the shipping. I bought the Nikon Coolpix S3500. Just a little bit more money and does a much better job.", negetive
"One review remarked that the cord for uploading onto a computer was missing \- figured that was probably a fluke...however...nocord\! No memory card\! A miniscule user manual. We had to download a user manual \- 109 pages on our printer\! We had to goout and buy the transfer cord. And, we have yet to be able to get an old memory card transferred\! This is shoddy stuff and I wassure it had \"Made in China\" somewhere on the packaging...however it says \"Canada\" \- maybe we\'d\'ve been better off had it beenMade in China\!\?\! If it weren\'t such a pain, I would return this in a minute\! This is not worthy of Amazon\'s quality and is the firsttime I have been disappointed by anything I\'ve ever ordered. I just hope the printer we recently ordered is of higher quality andnot so confusing \- and comes with instructions\!", negetive

I lost all the previous pix when I did this.. After taking a few more pictures I got the same message only this time I was not able to choose \"format\" from the cameras set up menu...I don\'t know why... it just would not allow me to select \"format\" ..  buy a coolpix by nikon.. they are very user friendly .Now I have to return this un usable piece of junk to a target store very far from my home.", negetive

Pictures taken came out with incorrect colors and blurred.  Hoping this was a bad one, but with 2 days until Christmas had to go out and buy local.", negetive
"I returned it\!  All the pictures were blurry\; and when checking it out on YouTube, I found that others had the same experience...out of focus pictures.  I am now looking for a camera to replace this but am leary since the reviews were good.  Apparently people were paid to say it was good, or Canon put out a big batch of bad cameras\!  Since I had another Canon that I wasn\'t happy with years ago, I won\'t buy another Canon.", negetive
"The promotion was buy the camera and get a sd card and case free.....need to read the fine print...order separate...why make it so difficult.

"NOTE\: This review\/low rating is ONLY regarding the current promotion which lists this camera as including a FREE CASE and MEMORY CARD.The listing makes it appear that a case and memory card will be included when ordering from Amazon LLC... however, be warned, those items WILL NOT be included automatically.  You must add them to your order with the camera.  Furthermore, your cart will show them as priced separately and the promotional discount will not appear until you click the \"estimate shipping and tax\" tab... which makes no sense... but that\'s the convoluted way amazon has set this up.Suggestion to Amazon\: If there is to be a promotional item\(s\) applied to a purchase, why not add them to the order AUTOMATICALLY and allow the buyer the option to REMOVE them if desired... rather than requiring the buyer to add those items manually while making it appear as though those items will NOT be free until the moment the order is placed\?

"I have ordered the camera with Amazon 2 weeks back. The D600 case had many scratches and looks like it is opened before. The plastic cover for battery is crumbled and the battery had some scratches. The Nikon body wrap doesn\'t look like well packed.  It looks like the used item.  I\'m so disappointed and returned the item back to Amazon.  So please be aware of this and check your product before use.I got my money back and ordered it from B\&H. I could see the difference between used and new.I\'m great fan of amazon, but due to this incident, I have lost the trust.But trust me, the camera quality is great. Before buying I was bit worried on seeing the sample images in the internet, but trust me, the photo quality is amazing.I\'m giving 1 start because of shipping the used or open item as new.", negetive
"Do NOT buy this piece of crap.  I accumulates dust in the upper left corner of the sensor faster than that you can clean it.  See the other reviews to see what I mean.  If I could return it to Amazon, I most assuredly WOULD\!  It\'s not worth a dime to me.I also purchased a D800 that is in the Nikon Repair shop because it\'s also a piece of crap with an \"oil on the sensor\" issue that seems to be a common problem.  Nikon, what the He\*\* are you doing to this brand\?", negetive
"After exactly 250 shots, my D600 completely shut down.  No power, no response to anything.Up until that point \(first 3 days with it\), it was awesome.  The pictures were fantastic, editing the RAW images was fine using ViewNX2 that came with it.  I did have to uninstall my older version of ViewNX2 to get it to work.  But no real issues there.The video was outstanding as well.  Love the mic input.But none of that really matters when it stops working.  The battery is fully charged, it is just behaving as though it has no power.I was so excited to receive this camera.  This is just so darn disappointing.\*\*\*UPDATE\*\*\*New D600 arrived yesterday \(Tuesday\).  After letting the battery get a full charge, it appears to be working fine.  I tested the non\-working D600 just to see if it was a faulty battery, and it was not.  The original D600 still showed no signs of life even with the new battery that was powering a working D600.  So The issue does appear to be in the camera.Amazon\'s purchase and return experience has been fantastic, and deserves mention.  When I pre\-ordered it they sent me an email from a \"camera concierge\", letting me know that someone was going to be watching my order and making sure it was delivered on time.  It was delivered on the date they said it would when I pre\-ordered.  So Sunday morning, I sent them an email explaining the failure on Saturday night.  I received a call back from them a few hours later.  I explained the issue, and after no longer than a 5 minute phone call, Amazon had my replacement on the way.  It arrived on Tuesday \(yesterday\), and UPS will pick up the non\-working D600 at my house on Wednesday \(today\).  I don\'t often return things, but I have to say this is probably the best exchange experience I\'ve had so far.  Amazon made this very easy for me.  So thank you to them.  They deserve 5 stars.\*\*\* Second Update \*\*\*My replacement D600 started having memory card issues after 50 or so shots, it read \-E\- for the memory card in slot one, I popped out the card, and popped it back in and it worked fine for another hundred or so shots.  This happened 4 times, then stopped happening and it worked fine for about 500 shots after that.  There were no issues with slot 2.  When I swapped cards between slot and 2, the issue stayed with slot 1.  If it were a memory card issue, I would have expected to see that error appear for slot 2 after a while, but it never did.This combined with my previous experience has me very concerned about the quality of this camera.  I returned it today.  Once again, Amazon was great, UPS picked up the camera from my house today, and Amazon will issue a full refund.", negetive
"It is just incredible how Nikon could not solve and support loyal users. The D7000 was a disaster about oil spoils in sensor, they did not solve the problem and refuse to recognize it, they did it again with the D7100 and now my D600 has the same problem\! I can just say it is unfair and time will say, but I anticipate a lot like me will at the end refuse to accept the arrogant Nikon atitude.  It would help, a lot, that Nikon could know about this three words, loyalty, honesty and humility. They just do not look the way I think Japanese are. On the other side, Sony is coming, the A7 is here, cheeper, nicer, lighter and without any problem, at least my Sony Nex 7 has been working great without any problem, so as I use to say, to the time\!\!\!", negetive
"As expected, lawyers have stepped in \- long overdue but still the right step in resolving this issue for unsuspecting nikon buyers\: \[...\]", negetive
"I bought the D600 about a year ago and since then the camera presents the evil dust oil issues. The issue was not resolved after sensor cleaning, actually it got worst making the camera completely useless. The first few pictures I took with the camera \(less than 1,800\) were amazing but the oil issues ruined the others after. I\'m pretty sure that the replacement \(D610\) have the potential to be a great camera as the D600 but just the fact that Nikon didn\'t want to acknowledge the issue and provide the right solution is unacceptable. They know that even cleaning the sensor is not the solution. Many D600 customer has been complaining that after multiple sensor cleaning and even \"change in sensor\" \(done at a Nikon Center\) the camera recur in the same dust\-oil issues. Please my concern is for those that are about to buy the new D610 after my experience with the D600...what are the guarantee that you have as a customer that Nikon will take care of any problem that you can possibly face with a \$2,000 camera\? Right now many D600 owners \(including me\) have a camera that not only is useless but because of this issue it can be resell. The right solution will be to replace the D600 for the\"new\" D610 to those that like me have a \$2,000 useless camera in a bag. Please Nikon be responsible and be more customer conscious, if you really know what business is and value your customers.", negetive
"I have been without my camera for a month now because it\'s in for repairs. Oil Oil Oil on the sensor. BUY THE 610.I\'ve never been more disappointed in a product before. I\'ve spent 2000 dollars on a piece of crap and it breaks my heart that Nikon DOESN\'T own up to their mistake.", negetive
"Nikon has finally admitted to the well\-documented problems with spots on the D600 sensor.  Look at sites like dpreview, lens rentals, and the reviews here and you will see this is a real and serious problem.My D600 was sent in for service three times and was not fixed, so they do not have a solution for it yet.  I was getting spots on my sensor every 200 shots and these spots would not come off with a rocket blower.  It is not acceptable to have to clean one\'s sensor that often.  One can not even get through a casual day of photographing, let alone if one was using this camera professionally.  I gather that camera sensors might need to be cleaned every 10,000 or so shots, but NOT every 200, that is unacceptable.The D600 has the potential to be an amazing camera, but DO NOT BUY it until Nikon fixes the underlying cause of the spots problem.  When you do buy it, I recommend buying from Amazon, an authorized Nikon dealer and also a great company who stood behind me, their customer.  5 stars to Amazon, 0 stars to the D600.", negetive
"Oil spots are a reality with the shutter mechanism on this camera.  Do not buy it unless you are prepared to clean off the oil spots on a regular basis.", negetive
"I bought a refurbished D600 with a shutter count of 113 which made me happy. I took 5 shots and they looked like a petree dish. Spots all over the top left.I had an argument and a half with Nikon and their \'courtesy clean\' which of course does not fix the issue. The D610 came out within 12 months this was such a major problem.If you like the camera just pay the extra and get a new D610 but don\'t buy the D600, its a lot of money on something that will leave you with photos that are useless.  There are a ton of these on ebay now because people can\'t get Nikon to swap them out for the D610 which they should as its effectively the same replacement camera.", negetive
"I thought that I had a clean camera, but it was not the case. I bought the D600 from B\&H. After about 3000 actuations, I saw spots which appear like grease or oil on the photos \(about 40\-50 spots\). I tried to use the rocket bowler to clean the sensor but the spots were still there.  I had to send it to Nikon for sensor cleaning, no questions asked.  Very disappointed in this camera and the way Nikon is handling this.", negetive
"I have shot with Nikon for many years \(since 1976\). I\'ve also owned 3 other digital bodies and 3 film, I consider myself a very serious amateur photographer. I was looking forward to the full frame D600 even before the release and spent \$2095 buying the body which I paired with Nikon\'s new 28 \- 85 mm lensThe first thing I noticed was that after a long shooting day \(over 500 images\), when I downloaded files in bridge was very visible spots \(appeared to be oil\) on the sensor. The dust spots continued to get worse and at the point of my images were impossible to use I returned my camera to the store where I purchased the store cleaned my sensors and reported that all was well.  In less than 500 shots the dust returned.  I again returned the camera to the store and was told there was nothing else they could do except return the camera back to Nikon for service.  Now, I am without a camera for a minimum of six weeks and have no grantee that the problem will be resolved.I have called Nikon customer service and was told that these isolated cases are being handled case by case and that what you read on the internet are not necessary true.  I also received an email from Nikon with the same response.  Man up Nikon.There seems to me a manufacturing issue which is causing the spots to appear in the pictures after 150\+ or so shots.  At this point I am not recommending to anyone that they purchase this or any other Nikon product.I am very disappointed the product and have been told that there were no widespread problems.  So a camera that owned less than three months and spent \$2095 on, in addition to \$600 for a lens is defective.Nikon needs to\:  offer a free solution and acknowledge there is a problem.", negetive
"I am on my second D600 body. The first one was purchased here on Amazon next week after the camera launched. The dust accumulated after first 100 shots and some of the particles would not go away even after the Rocket Air blower was used several times. The dust spread out very quickly \(not just in the upper left corner\) and after 2000 shots, the ENTIRE sensor was covered with spots, over 10 of which were visible at F4 and a couple at F2.8. Returned the camera, waited a month or so and got another one. After first 5 shots \- several spots appeared. Serial \# starts with 3031XXX. After another 2000 pictures taken, it seems to be worse then the first body. Some of the spots are REALLY large and I cannot blow them away. Do not want to do the wet clean myself and not willing to be without the camera for 2\-3 weeks and deal with horrible Nikon service \(most recently had my Speedlight SB\-800 serviced, could not get it back from them for a month \- awful experience\!\) Have to shoot a wedding today, I will use my F1.4 and F1.8 optics to avoid visible spots. This is absolutely unacceptable and disturbing. This was my dream\-come\-true camera. I loved the weight of it, the feel, the features, the image quality...  I feel so frustrated with this problem\!\!\!I was considering D800, but because of the file size and possible left AF problem decided against it.So... Now what\? I have recently invested in bunch of Nikon lenses and really love them. I really want this camera to work and will probably give another D600 one more shot. I will update this review and change it to 5 stars, once they fix this REAL problem at the manufacturing level.", negetive
"The Nikon D600 has either design or manufacturing flaws of the oil dust on its sensor. You will have pictures with many tiny black dots. It\'s Nikon\'s responsibility to\- Stopping selling the defective product, or\- Recall it and issue credit to its customers.It\'s unethical to continuously sell this defective D600 camera with a discount to the consumers.", negetive
"same thing with other reviews memtioned, \:\(  otherwise it\'s a very good camera.  I wish Nikon will fix this problem soon.", negetive
"This camera is a piece of crap.I bought a refurbished one that had supposedly had it\'s sensor issues fixed. The more I photographed the worse it became. So KEH, my seller, exchanged it out. Next camera had the exact same issue. They offered me a third camera but by this point I\'d done enough research to know I could be playing this game awhile.  So I exchanged and upgraded to the D800E. So glad I did plus the extras I bought for the D600 work with the D800E.", negetive
"Wow Nikon has always been my camera of choice and I have the D800 as well, had the D90, D7000, D7100 then jumped up to the D800 and now this..... But after maybe 500 shots I had dirt on the sensor or my D60 so I just hoped it was normal, forked over the \$75 and got it cleaned. Now after 150 shots or less I have even more crap on the upper part of my sensor with just this small number of shots. Never took my lens off outside and clean conditions. My guess, my camera that I purchased here at Amazon on Aug 7th is another one that has this issue with the gap around the shutter. I am trying to get Amazon to flex its muscles and get me a refund because I surely don\'t want to deal with Nikon and the way they have handled this whole situation. If not for the residue on the sensor the D600 rocks. But thats not my reality nor the camera I paid \$2000 for. Just get the D610. Don\'t even think about getting a used or refurbished D600.", negetive
"I have the D600 with many problems like focusing and not excepting firmware updates. You can buy the D 610 for less.", negetive
"I am very disappointed with the way NIKON has handled this entire D600 fiasco.  I can best alert you against this camera by copying the words from a recent review.  These are not my words but serve as a good guide.  I hope NIKON will read this and be very ashamed.  I was very lucky because I was able to return the entire D600 camera kit to Costco after I pleaded with them and showed them how this camera is defective and NIKON will not face up to it and instead kicked the consumer in the gut by correcting the problem with the introduction of D610, instead of doing the morally ethical thing of recalling the D600s.  I too noticed the oil and dirt spots on my pictures.  The following is taken from\[...\] \:Here\'s a quote from a Nikon dealer\:\"Nikon has devalued our remaining new \[D600\] inventory and will make it almost impossible for us to sell it off short of taking big losses. We\'re already trying to move our current inventory by taking a \$100 hit on the profit side and I don\'t think that\'s going to be enough. If anyone thinks I\'m ordering new D610\'s today \(short of specific order requests\) they\'re nuts.\"Now let\'s look at things from a well\-informed prospective customer viewpoint\:  Choice 1\: a D600 that might or might not have a shutter issue  Choice 2\: a D610 that fixes the shutter issue \(to assume otherwise would also be to assume that Nikon is totally incompetent, in which case see Choice 3 \;\~\)  Choice 3\: buy a Canon 6D  Rumored Choice 4\: Sony and Pentax introducing competitive full frame camerasWhat I fail to understand is Nikon\'s behavior here. They have done the following by staying quiet about the D600 issues and trying to get around them by doing a sleight of hand with the D610\:  Eroded key customer confidence  Devalued a product by their actions, which leads to\:  Lowered their product margins  Added another lingering inventory problem, which also leads to lower profit marginsCoupled with all the repair costs that the D600 triggered, how can Nikon\'s response be the right answer to the problem\? In retrospect, the proper solution was to recall all D600\'s and examine them for defective shutters. If found, replace it and charge the cost of that replacement to their shutter supplier. That kind of response should have\:  Increased key customer confidence  Not devalued the product  Lowered their product margins \(cost of shipping cameras, inspecting them\)  Not created a lingering inventory problem or the need for another productBut here\'s another new problem I\'m seeing in my In Box. Consider this quote\: \"My D600 is coming up on end of warranty. I\'m not a heavy user so I\'m not sure if my camera has the problem. It seems like it needs more cleaning than I expected. What happens when my warranty expires\? Will Nikon still replace my shutter for free if it\'s defective\?\"Nikon is, as usual, will likely remain silent on such questions, which isn\'t going to increase customer confidence.

"From Nikon in Europes homepage\:To users of the Nikon D600 digital SLR cameraThank you for choosing Nikon for your photographic needs.Some users have indicated the appearance of multiple granular dust spots in images captured with the Nikon D600 digital\-SLR camera. These granular dust spots are reflections of internal dust generated with camera operation, or external dust particles that have found their way into the camera, either, or both of which, have adhered to the camera\'s low\-pass filter.While the structure and concept of digital\-SLR cameras makes the complete elimination of these dust spots very difficult, it has come to our attention that, in some rare cases, they may be reflected noticeably in images. Therefore, Nikon is informing users of a service to reduce this issue.ResolutionAs a first step, please follow the guidance from the User\'s Manual \(pages 301\-305\) related to the \"Clean Image Sensor\" function and manual cleaning using a blower. If these measures do not remove all dust particles and you are still experiencing problems, then please consult your nearest Nikon service center. They will keep your camera, examine it thoroughly, and service it as needed.\[...\]", negetive
"Nice fx camera and comfortable in the hand . Great pictures with mid price nikon lens but the spots continue to haunt this model. The sensor after 150 shots has spots on it. When you enlarge a photo is when you can see how bad it is. I waited to order one to end of year thinking the bad ones were returned but no luck, i got a bad one. I don\'t relish having to have the sensor cleaned almost out of the box.", negetive
"At \$700 off for the kit I was close to buying.  Without that incentive, I am going to wait until they get the internal debris problem fixed.  Nikon seems to use their customers as beta testers.  It seems like every time they come out with a new DSLR it has some kind of problem.  The D70 \(which I own\) had front\/rear focus issues.  It seems like Nikon got around that buy adding focus tuning on the higher end cameras.  Nothing like \"do it yourself\" QA.  The D800 has left\/right focus issues.  The D7000 and now the D600 are plagued by \"internal debris.\"  Do some research on Nikon D600 dust\/oil.  Hey Nikon, How about some good old fashioned Japanese quality\?  I know a lot of this stuff is manufactured in Thailand, but still.  Get it fixed or drop the price again.Added after the initial review\:Last week I spent dozens of hours researching the D600, including trying it out in a camera shop. The folks in the camera shop were well aware of the oil\/dust issue. I called Nikon USA service and here is what they told me\:1\) Not all D600 bodies have this issue. Only some do.2\) If you purchase a D600 that has the issue Nikon will take care of the problem. They will clean the sensor.3\) If the problem recurs, they will clean the sensor again. If they determine that the body can\'t be repaired, they \"will see\" if they can replace it. When asked what \"will see\" means, he said that if it is in stock.4\) Nikon has not compiled a list of affected serial numbers.5\) Nikon doesn\'t have an understanding of what is causing the problem on some D600 bodies.6\) The customer is responsible for the cost of shipping the body to Nikon for the checkout\/cleaning.I am sure that this camera takes great photos.  But for \$2,000 do you want a camera that may need to go back to Nikon for periodic sensor cleanings\?  Nikon, please fix this problem.Added on January 8th\:If you want to read more on the internal debris issue, check out the D600 reviews from DPReview, Ryan Brenizer or Thom Hogan.  I\'d post a link, but Amazon doesn\'t allow external URLs.Added on January 10th, 2013\:Another place to research this issue is lenrentals.com.  They have an extensive article on the D600 sensor debris issue.  They own dozens of D600 so there experience is based on many D600s, not a single sample.", negetive
"I just returned my second D600 due to the sensor spots.  The first one went back 24 hours after I got it.  The camera store people were nice and gave me a replacement, and even checked for sensor spots before it went out the door.  I was there.  We saw nothing.  I got home, did some shooting, checked it the next day, found maybe four or five sensor spots \-\- to me, that\'s a little soon, but still acceptable.  Today I returned it after a day of shooting, indoors, no dust, one lens change \-\- and literally dozens of sensor spots.  I made a phone call to Nikon, and the rep told me she\'d never heard of this \-\- yeah, right.  In the meantime, several other photographer friends are having the same problem.  Nikon clearly has an issue with these.  Things happen, but to pretend it isn\'t, despite widespread reports by photographers, photographic sites, and even camera rental places, is unacceptable.  It\'s a shame, because in all other ways, it\'s a wonderful camera for the price, full of features, and usable by pros and amateurs alike.  It\'s a great move into full\-frame, because it offers the option of shooting DX, so as to be able to use existing lenses.  But when quality is bad, none of the rest matters.", negetive
"I own the nikon d700 for a year and half and was looking forward to upgrading my nikon bodies. I intended to get the d800 and the d600. I did many research into these bodies. Finally it was down to decision time, knowing that the d800 has left focus issue the d600 has oil issue, i still went ahead and bought the d600 hoping that I won\'t get a bad copy because the d700 is such a \"reliable\" and a great camera. I was giving the nikon brand the benefit of the doubt. Well what do you know, oil start appearing on my d600. Return it back immediately.A customer spending this much cash on a product from a nikon brand should have the peace of mind of buying a quality product.  I don\'t understand why Nikon is denying the fact that the d600 has oil problem on its sensor.  Do they think that their customers are dumb asses\?The entire chain of command within nikon is tarnishing what this brand stand for.I now own a Canon 5d Mark iii.", negetive
"This camera sprays oil from the mechanical shutter on to the sensor, causing spots on the images you photograph.  The problem doesn\'t show up until you\'ve owned the camera for several months.  Then Amazon doesn\'t want to issue you a full credit.It\'s the worst.  Don\'t buy a D600 and don\'t buy it on Amazon", negetive
"THIS JUST IN\: Had trouble using an AI 200mm Micro\-Nikkor lens on this camera. Found little help in the thick manual or using Google, searching AI. And so...I called Nikon.After the rep checked for about 60 seconds or more with someone else, I get this response, confirmed in writing\: \"Thank you for calling Nikon today. I am sending you an email confirming that your D600 is not compatible with AI lenses. If you have anymore questions please feel free to give us a call back.\"THANK YOU, THANK YOU KEN ROCKWELL \(A HERO, like travel advocate CHRIS ELLIOTT\)\: \"\(rude word\)\/use the NON CPU LENS data menu and you\'re good to go\!\" And so I would be, except seconds after the Nikon ruling, I obtained a return authorization from B\&W \(generous, since just past 30 days\), and immediately caught the postal carrier. So out about \$35 for two\-way shipping on the aforementioned lens.Support Rockwell and Elliott for the betterment of humanity, or something short of that.PREVIOUS\:Reconditioned D600 arrived with a mini\-minor issue\: the rear screen protector kept falling off. From examination, the top tab seems to have been broken.A call to Nikon Service brought a shuffle, with the first representative indicating that this might not be covered \-\- after two days from purchase. The next representative started grilling me on whether I knew how the screen worked, if I had broken it. To hell with Nikon. I hung up and order another from China for pennies. And for this it has totally annoyed a 48\-year customer, before retirement a member of NPS \(Nikon Professional Services\).", negetive
"This could have been a fantastic camera had Nikon handles its customers\' complaints seriously. Instead they pretended there were no problems and that only a few isolated users had problems with oil spots. Now Nikon has further upset its customers by releasing the D610 further de\-valuing the D600. I will never purchase another NIkon product unless they eventually recall the D600 and make it right.By the way if you have a D600 and never saw any oil spots take your camera off the automatic setting and shoot a landscape with clouds at f22. You will see the oil spots right away.", negetive
"Had my D600 for a couple months and didn\'t notice too much of a problem.  We were into over 5000 photos when dust spots suddenly went from mild to severe over the period of about 4 hours ..... during a product photo shoot.  I was so embarrassed for my equipment and I didn\'t have a clue what to tell the manufacturer, who finally left and asked to reschedule once the equipment was repaired.  I was embarrassed to say the least.Anyway, I just received my camera back from Nikon.  They still won\'t say what is going on or if it was really \"fixed\" or just cleaned.  Time will tell, I guess, but I am so discouraged because I don\'t know if this will continue or not. Of note, I had a D200 for 5 years and never needed the sensor cleaned once, and the D600 needed cleaning in the first 3\-4 months.  To make matters worse, Nikon took almost 4 weeks to return the camera, that sucks.  They have a web site where you can find updates, but it\'s all but worthless\: they use cryptic codes to say what is going on, and they may or may not update the site, so it really doesn\'t reflect what is going on.  For instance, the site said it was done for 6 days, and when I called them, they said, \"well sometimes when it says \"bill\" for a long period of time, it\'s actually been shipped.\"  So even their own techs know that the web site info means nothing.Something is clearly wrong here and from the reviews, I don\'t think it\'s a small percentage at all.  One rental place said all 20 of their cameras were effected.  20\/20 with the same issue\?  Mnnn.I hope this isn\'t a life long issue with this camera.  It was cleaned under warranty although I am not sure why ... if it were something I did, they wouldn\'t cover it under warranty would they\?I wouldn\'t have bought the camera if I knew about this issue.  I would have waited, it\'s just not worth the embarrassment and unknown future.  I surely can\'t send this camera in for 4 weeks several times a year ...not to mention that after the warranty is gone, I will have to pay for it.I wouldn\'t recommend this camera at all right now.  Once Nikon says they have the problem fixed ...... then no problem.UPDATE\:  So the review above was done in Early 2013.  Since then I sent the camera back in July 2013 and I was told they replaced the shutter.  Today, October 2013, I am sending the camera back for the third time for the same dirt\/dust\/oil spots.  After talking with Nikon support over and over again concerning the same problem, it\'s my opinion that there is little sympathy or understanding of what this is putting customers through.  Out of 12 months that I have owned the camera, it has been out of my hands for more than two months.  That\'s not the bad part.  The bad part is they apparently don\'t know how to repair this problem and I am stuck with a dud.  The attitude that I get from Nikon is, \"well, that\'s just your bad luck.\"  They also \"have no information about the problem.\"  It\'s just surreal dealing with these people.  It would seem no one knows anything and no one has the \"authorization\" to do anything to make the situation right.  The support is nice enough, just none of them know or can do anything.  I have never had an experience quite like this with a technology company.  Anyway, at this point, I don\'t want the camera anymore.  It\'s not reliable and they apparently don\'t know how to repair the problem yet.  This is just not worth the hassle, for me.  I hope this helps someone else.", negetive
"I was expecting that dirty sensor issue was limited to only few cameras. It looks that I was mistaken. Beside purchasing camera from Amazon I did go to BestBuy an Costco and cameras from all places were  showing dirt on their sensors. I returned all of them and now wait and see if Nikon will correct the problem.", negetive
"I really believe there is no excuse to give this product a 3 and above stars rating, even if it takes amazing pics. I do not buy a Ferrari to have its fuel injection system cleaned every 100 miles, and then I say...\"OK, that is fine, it is a Ferrari \!\". This is just an absurd Nikon has to address. I was a Nikon guy during all of my photographic amateur life, and I had several models from the 4004, N90, to an F4, to a D70, 7000 and a 700 now. I wanted a new body, and it will not be a Nikon, unfortunately.I live in a Country with an absurd tax regulation system charges and a less than desirable quality level of service from Nikon. I just can not afford to buy a product I know I will have to have it serviced regularly. This is not something \(wet cleaning the sensor\) a normal person can do alone.I hope they fix this and promote a decent recall. This is not a 10 bucks product \!Before someone asks\: I have not bought one, but the guy next to me did and it had the same oil issue 2 days later. Incredible.", negetive
"I was eagerly awaiting this impressive camera since first pictures started showing up on rumors web sites. I\'m not a photographer, just an enthusiast but the time came to upgrade my Pentax iST\-dx and I wanted to get something of a high quality which will produce photo and video assets you can be proud of for years to come. So after consulting with my family \(\$2600 is a big deal for our budget\), reading a bunch of favorable reviews \(including Amazon\'s dpreview.com\) I decided to buy into Nikon platform and D600 in particular. Soon after expiration of the 30 days Amazon return policy, the infamous dust issue started happening. Since Amazon would now charge a prohibitive restocking percentage I decided to wait until \"the dust settles\" and sell it on eBay with a small discount. To my surprise Nikon dropped price for the same kit I bought they ask \$700 less and that is just 3 month after the product launch. I think they decided it will be cheaper to do this instead of recalling the camera. My value in this camera vanishing quicker than real estate equity after the housing bubble. Why bother admitting the guilt if you can just burn early adopters and drop 25\% \(huge margin allows them\) so people will be impulsively buying their defective product without reading reviews. I\'m calling to launch a class action against Nikon, it seem this is the only language their corporate management listens to. And one more thing. Did anyone noticed that after being acquired by Amazon, dpreview.com is now playing along with manufacturers\? They sure get more access to the exclusive per\-releases but it seems that credibility plummeted.", negetive
"This is a long post. The quick synopsis is as follows\: The D600 HAS an issue with dust and oil. They have admitted to an issue finally in Feb. Their cust service is the worst I have experienced. After 6 months we got a full credit from the vendor and purchased a Canon 6D. We are thrilled with the Canon. The technical features are not the D600 but the Canon has not come with the free oil and dust spots that the D600 came with. For more details please feel free to read the entire post. BUYER BEWARE.I bought my wife a D600 in November at this great price of \$2,395 from a different vendor \(Amazon did not have the same price.\) With the holidays we were not able to do too much with it but by February we noticed the issue of dust\\oil\\noise on many of her pictures. My wife was a professional photographer and as we get closer to retirement we are thinking of a small cottage photo business or just enjoying a passionate hobby. This should have been a great experience.We went to the Addison Texas Nikon photo school on Feb 23 and 24th. We decided to wait until after the class to send it in as we followed Nikon\'s protocol. They reviewed the pictures we sent in and they said send it to them in California. On the 25th we sent it in which cost us \$137 \(\$122 for shipping and insurance and another \$15 for the box and packing materials.\) We sent it in two day UPS. They did not even acknowledge receipt of the camera until the next week even thought we had proof of delivery. Once they looked at it they simply cleaned the sensor and sent it back.Right out of the box, we barely had the camera body open for 10 seconds while we attached a lens, we experienced the same problem. We called them and went through the hassle of sending in the pictures. By the way we received different instructions each time for the proper way to send files and each time it took several tries. They really should know how to handle large files and be consistent. We implied once again that we did not want to have to pay another \$137 to send it back. We received the same email saying sorry but you will need to send us the camera again. We had enough. We were never offered a prepaid UPS label.We went to a great local distributor. We did not buy this from them but since we have shopped there before they were gracious enough to listen to our situation and send it in to the Melville operation on our behalf. Just like you our camera was put on parts hold. They eventually, after 4 weeks and me getting on the phone with them, replaced the shutter mechanism and did a complete low pass filter cleaning. They sent it back apologizing for the issues and even sent me a check to repay me for my original shipping. They explained I should have been offered a free shipping label. There were several other miscommunications that are irrelevant as they had nothing to do with the issue at hand.The camera arrived at the distributor on Thursday and we picked it up on Friday. We shot some pics on Saturday and went to the Dallas zoo on Sunday to put it through some real shooting. We got home Sunday evening and we saw the issue reappear. We started shooting at around 11\:30 AM at 1\:05 PM we noticed the first issue. We figured this out as we reviewed the shots Sunday evening using Nikon\'s software. The spots gradually got worse. Yes we do have the pics to back all of this up which we eventually got to send to Nikon on Monday.Monday afternoon they issues an overnight UPS label. I boxed the camera up and sent it back to them. They had a manager intercept put on the label to review. My wife will be travelling internationally next week and we needed the camera \(we requested a replacement\) before she left. I heard nothing on Tuesday morning but followed up and found out that they had it. I was told I would hear back later that day or early today.  Nothing again. I call up and am told they will speak with the service manager and put in a request for a replacement camera. I would hear within 24 hours. In less than 6 hours they called me and said that the service manager said there is only one spot and they are simply going to clean it and send it back.Now the pictures clearly show more than one spot and additional noise or again more spots. I asked them to review that as I do not believe they reviewed the pictures although why would they agree to overnight something for pickup after they saw the pictures if there was only one spot\?So in less than a week I received a refurbished camera with a new shutter mechanism and a cleaned low pass filter. In less than 4 days they requested the camera back. This is the third time it is in for the same issue. They did not offer to replace the camera. They are simply going to send it back after a sensor clean.Here is the dilemma\: The original place I purchased the camera from has graciously agreed to take it back and put me into another camera. They said we could either get another D600, a different camera or a store credit. That is customer service. That is a great customer experience. Nikon should learn a lesson from this. Right now I am leaning towards getting rid of our Nikon Gear. You see we also bought a D3200 and a Nikon 105MM micro lens as well as some other smaller items. That may  sound drastic but that is how they have made us feel. We would rather have a nice working model of the D600 but how do I in good conscience reward them with more business after how we were treated and how the other people with poorly working D600 were treated. While I have no idea how prevalent the issue is, the manner in which they have handled it is disgusting. I am happy for all the people who I know and hear about that have working D600. However, a \$2000 plus investment for a consumer or a pro is a significant amount of money. With Nikon currently reporting more than a \$159M profit this quarter \(down almost 50\% on a 5\% increase in sales\), why should their customers take this kid of treatment\?For everyone with a good working D600 enjoy. For everyone who has been treated poorly by Nikon customer service I empathize with you. Luckily there are still some great companies that treat their customers with exceptional respect. Nikon could learn a thing or two. They have brought fumeiyo upon themselves.", negetive
"The camera has two problems. First, dust and\/or oil accumulates on thee sensor and needs constant attention. This is especially a problem at higher f\-stops. Just dial up to f16 or higher and you\'ll notice hundreds of dots. And it doesn\'t stop after a few thousand activations, as some have indicated. It is also a problem on all the d600s, not just the first ones. If that weren\'t bad enough, Nikon still pretends that this isn\'t a problem, even though they\'ve introduced a replacement camera, the 610. Worse, they imply that it is a user problem. I would avoid the 600 and not trust Nikon on anything. They\'ve lost all credibility. The 600 is largely unusable unless you want to risk damaging the sensor, which might be okay because the camera is basically a \$2000 paperweight.", negetive
"The dust issue continues to reoccur OVER and OVER. Local camera shop will clean sensor for \$90. EACH TIME this happens I need to fork over \$90\?\?\? And it happens frequently. Every 1000 shots or so. I won\'t rehash what others have said about Nikon and the D610 but this is so disappointing after spending \$2K on this body.", negetive
"The dust and oil splatter showed up on the sensor just past the 1,000 activation mark.  Since I bought this as a backup camera I did not notice the problem until long after my warranty ran out. I purchased a sensor cleaning kit and have now wet cleaned the sensor at least 15 times not to mention almost daily blowouts of the sensor box with a Rocket Blaster to clear dust.  Now with more than 17 thousand activations, it appears the oil and dust issue may be behind me. Would I buy this camera again\? NO. Would I recommend it\? NO. I think Nikon handled this problem with the D600 very badly. I might consider the D610 but not until the refurbished models come out later this year.", negetive
"I received it a month ago. It came with three big pieces dusts on the sensor. Did a air blow clean, then after 20\+ picture taken, more dusts showing up. I cleaned it again, after 200\+ pictures taken, more than 50 spots of dust\/oil showed up on the sensor again. And Nikon does not have any acknowledgement on this known issue to many customers. It is totally unacceptable. D600 is becoming a self\-contamination machine\!", negetive
"I\'m writing this review at the point where I\'m returning the 2nd body I had back to Amazon. There are two parts to understand, the camera itself, and the issue plaguing majority of these bodies. The first body I had was bought in September 2012, and after buying, I immediately went on an international trip, which was going to be several months, since the body had just come out, and as I was traveling I had not heard about the sensor dust issue. I was shooting away and it was all good. At one point in time I was attending, the Formula 1 Indian Grand Prix 2012 \(I\'ll be attaching a couple pictures\), and I had tickets for all three days, being with a new camera I wanted to test it out and see how the system worked with Sports, given the camera has an unusually small AF area, if you compare it with a D7000, even the D7000\'s coverage is better, but I usually use the center focus point, and I dont mind that too much, but thats just me, some people use all focus points and for them, this is not exactly the best focusing system, in fact this is in my opinion is the biggest downside of the camera technically, which could be a deal breaker for some people.Anyway coming back to the grand prix, so for those 3 days, I used the camera on Continuous high speed, which was using burst of 10 pictures or so, throughout. I got a satisfactory enough keepers, which kind of also proved for me that the camera can do pretty decent in situations such as one I went though. However once I went home and started looking at the raw pics is when I realized the horror, at that point I had clicked about 4k Shutter actuation\'s, about 3k in the 3 days of grand prix shooting. And almost every picture was bloated with dust and oil, the final pictures I decided to process, were in hundreds, and I had to spend time for each and every one of them, the fact that cleaning out those dust spots is not necessarily easy when they are so many of them in each picture. This is when I googled and realized whats has been happening with the D600. I had a macro lens and I immediately took a picture stopped down, and I couldn\'t believe how dirty the sensor was. I immediately took it to a Nikon service center in New Delhi, India, I was charged about \$15 and I got a clean sensor back in half an hour, I hoped that would be the end of it, but it was not the case, after a few hundred shots the sensor was getting dirtier again. And this is when I decided I couldn\'t keep this body. I immediate spoke to Amazon, and they were ready to take it back, once I was back in US. After coming back and reading about how the D600 sensor issue was probably non existent in newer bodies, I decided to order again around New years, but unfortunately I got another body plagued with the same issue, I have now decided that, I\'ll be returning the D600 for a D800, although it doesn\'t necessarily fulfill all my needs, and it might come with some AF issues, however Nikon CAN fix that, and I probably am going to get it fixed, but in the case of D600, Nikon has been completely mum, leaving a good majority of its owners in the dark of any development what so ever, this is very cruel to me, if I hadn\'t invested in an Nikon ecosystem of lenses and flashes, I\'d have walked away Nikon.Leaving the dust issues aside, the D600 is an awesome camera, Dynamic Range, ISO performance, resolving power, and ease of use. Keeping in mind this is not a professional grade body, the cameras controls are very nicely aligned, and having a D7000, it was great to jump onto the slightly bigger body with slightly better ergonomics. If the camera bodies I had used were not having any dust issues, or if Nikon would have owned up to this issue and perhaps suggestion a future fix, I\'d had given the camera a 5 star rating, but with my experience so far, its going to remain 1.", negetive
"Even with the negative reviews here about the spotting issues I was willing to take a chance on getting a D600 that didn\'t have this problem, but it was not to be. within just a few shots I was able to see the dreaded spots  when I viewed the picture files my monitor. I completely cleaned the sensor only to have the lubricant spots come back within about 30\-35 shots. There was also an usualy amount of dust collecting on the sensor as well. If it wasn\'t for this problem the Nikon D600 would have been an awesome camera. I found the camera a joy to use and shoot with the controls all laid out in a logical \(to me that is\) manner. The live view worked espically well having the camera mounted on  a  tripod \(ReallyRightStuiff TQC\-14 and BH\-30 ballhead\).I can\'t think of anything I would change on the camera. Yes, I know many have moaned the lack of Exposure control in Movie mode, but I never got around to using movie mode myself. Sadly Nikon has really dropped the ball on QAULITY CONTROL  in producing the D600 and I see the problem exist in the D800 line as well. If not for the spotting problems I would have given the D600 a 5 star rating. Amazon, you should use your collective purchasing power and come down hard on Nikon for this mess, as it is costing you tons of lost revenue and many unhappy customers.", negetive
"...same dust and oil issues.  Purchased serial \#3004XXX. Within the first 20 shots noticed spots developing on sensor \(upper left in view finder\)and had dust inside prism area.  I removed many dust particles from the sensor with a \"rocket blower\" but the oil spots required a wet cleaning.  After cleaning, the spots started to reappear within 5 clicks so I returned the camera for a different unit.  Serial \#3035XXX.  The sensor was clean out of the box with only 4 shutter activations on the counter but dust and oil starting to appear at 35 clicks.  This body also has dust inside the prism box.  A rocket blower removed the dust but the oil spots remained.  I also noticed a small area on the mirror mechanism where the paint was starting to flake off, which I suspect is the source of the \"dust\".  These problems show up at f8 and are not user caused and make the camera unusable for landscape and video.  I returned it and the pro level lenses I purchased.  I\'m evauluating other options and would wait on purchasing this camera until Nikon solves these issues.", negetive
"I was worried about all the negative reviews regarding the dust\/oil spot on the sensor problem. I put 2000 shots through it. So far, I only see 3 dust spots, not a problem.  The serial no is 3011XXX.  The D600 is a great improvement, coming from the D700 and D300. I\'ll update if there is a dust issue with this D600.Update\:This is the best DSLR I have used. The oil\/dust flaw is real. 500 more shots and the oil\/dust spots got worse. 12 appeared on the high left. I\'ll try more shots to see if it\'ll stabilize. Nikon needs to address this issue. I have over 30 Nikon lenses so going to Canon is out of the question. With the D800 and the D600 having problems, sad days for Nikon users.Update\:12\/22\/2012The function and image quality are the best I have seen. 300 more shots, and the dust\/oil spots didn\'t get worse but are there if you look for it. The bottom line is how much can you accept. Nikon must come up with a resolution for the problems with both the D600 and D800. I will return this camera for an exchange, hoping that I\'ll get luck next time. For those of you who are still waiting, don\'t buy it until Nikon has a fix for it. After 25 years of using Nikon, I\'m slowly losing faith.Update\:12\/27\/2012Tested 2 additional D600 \(not from Amazon\) over the holiday. Same conclusion, dust\/oil spots when you get to 1500 to 2000 shots. One of the D600 has SN 500XXXX. Nikon has no solution for this problem, even with the newer production. If the spots is a problem you can\'t accept, return them. Amazon is good with the return\/refund policy.Update\:12\/30\/20122 more D600 bodies\(not from Amazon\), SN 50XXXXX, same dust\/oil spots, one at 1200 shots, the other at 1500 shots. I won\'t touch another D600 until I see this problem is fixed by Nikon.", negetive
"I purchased this camera to travel to South America. I had used a D7000 for a year and I have 4 other Nikon SLR bodies.  Two days into the trip spots started showing up. These are not dust spots since you can see them when the mirror is locked up and they appear as small smudges on the sensor. I finally did a wet cleaning of the sensor with swabs designed for that and most of them came off.  They seem to be back now. What a disappointment from Nikon. Don\'t buy this camera until this problem has been fixed. If I did not have so much Nikon glass I would be looking at Canon full frame cameras.", negetive
"I purchased the D600 body about a month ago. I had used all my savings that I have been saving for about 2 years. I was very excited to buy a full frame camera after having used D3000 for about 5 years of my life. In the beginning, when I used the camera with Tamron lenses to take event pictures it did its job. The quality was superb and the colors as well as the focusing capability were excellent. All pictures were done in aperture of f 3.5\~6However, recently I went to New Hampshire with the camera to hike the Lafayette Mountain. This time my main focus was to take excellent landscape pictures. In aperture of f11 to f 22, the pictures I thought they were perfectly focused and framed were filled with complete flaws when I checked with photoshop and lightroom. I saw numerous dust spots on the left corner of each pictures, and the focus was all over the place. Given the fact that there were lots of fogs and clouds as I reached the peak, I understood that sometimes it was hard for camera to decide what objects to focus. However, I was really shocked to see consistent dark spots at the same location of each pictures.It has been over a year since dust\/oil problem has been numerously addressed by thousands of customers and yet Nikon did not fix this problem.This shows that they do not give a s\*\*\*t about the customer\'s concerns as well as their reputation.I am planning on returning D600, Tamron 24\-70 3.5, and Nikor 85mm due to this issue. I will never go back to Nikon again.", negetive
"I was very excited to buy this camera last year when it got released. I haven\'t used this camera much over the last year. First few times i did not realize but on my most recent trip when i took my camera, i noticed a flaw in the camera where the ISO and aperture keeps changing automatically\! I set my ISO and aperture to some value, but when i click multiple photos, i get some photos that are underexposed and some that are overexposed.I don\'t know how i should fix this problem... \:\( I moved from Canon to Nikon for D600 for its features. I feel sad to have moved at all...", negetive
"After 1000 clicks, the sensor start to show dust on the left corner and Nikon refuse to fix it. As D600 owner, I feel that there is a level of quality that rides on the Nikon name and we pay a premium for this. when the quality drops below, I expect Nikon to stand behind and fix the problem. So disappointed", negetive
"Amazing camera... can\'t believe they sell it with the sensor dirty\!\!\!Iso performance is great.Good autofocus except for the autofocus points being only in the center... a pitty.Nikon doesn\'t cover the brand new dirt\/cleaning in the guarantee, so they want to charge me more than 100 USD for cleaning the brand new sensor.Pic showing dust\/oil spots\: i.imgur.com\/el01Vfx.jpg\?1", negetive
"This camera has a fatal flaw that is affecting a large number of D600s.  Specifically, the camera mechanism that raises the mirror during exposure is flinging lubricant onto the sensor.  This is completely unacceptable \-\- for more about this go to\: \[...\]Because of this, you get very distinct spotting on your images.  The website referenced about mentions that Lensrentals.com had to clean 100\% of their D600 bodies to fix the problem.For the record, I have three other pro\-grade Nikon DSLRs, and 20\+ Nikon lenses, and have shot only Nikon for 35 years.  I\'ve never seen anything like this on my other cameras.  My first 200 shots were fine, but the more I took the worse this problem became.  Sadly, I purchased the camera for the recent Formula One race in Austin, TX.  I took roughly 3,500 shots during the four days I was at the track.  I am infuriated that most of these shots will need extensive retouching to fix these flaws.If you already own one of these cameras it\'s easy to find the problem.  Shoot a picture of the sky or a light\-colored wall.  Underexpose a stop or two to help you see the spots.  If you have the issue it will be very apparent.And IF you have the issue please return your camera immediately\!  I don\'t have any issues with Nikon on a personal level, but they need to be pressured into fixing this problem \-\- and big companies don\'t spring into action unless financial circumstances warrant it.  If enough people return their D600s \-\- and if enough people complain and make this problem known \-\- Nikon will be forced to fix the design flaw.  Furthermore, they will be less likely to let another design with this flaw slip through into production.I hope this review keeps others from going through this same experience\!", negetive
"I really want to love this camera but unfortunately for me, the oil\/dust issues were real. I tried 3 cameras and all produced the same issue. I thought I had a winner with this last one as it was great out of the box but after approx. 700 shots the spots began to show. The feature set and price point are everything I am looking for, very sturdy body for a prosumer camera and would fit my needs perfectly. For me, I was ready to switch to Nikon, I just can\'t see spending \$4k on camera body and a couple lens to be left with this issue. When I called Nikon to see what they can do, my only option was shipping to them at my expense as they do not acknowledge an issue\! This is a 3 week old camera and that is flat unacceptable. I am convinced this is the camera I want, but will wait and let the dust settle, and see how Nikon handles the issue going forward. I am confident they will correct the issue, even if they don\'t admit to it. I usually don\'t write reviews but the issues were bad enough I felt I should. It is just something to consider for others looking at this as well. Do your homework on when the fixed units are out there. I am honestly surprised Amazon has not pulled this with all the other reviews on the same issue. I have seen them do similar things in the past with a receiver from Onkyo that myself and many others had issues with. Fortunately, Amazon is awesome to deal with and I never worry about them standing behind what they sell\!", negetive
"Horrible sensor issue just about 2000 shot\! Even can see the huge spot through the view finder\! Horrible customer service, it take them almost a month to get the camera fixed, and I get my camera back with huge scratch on the display\! If you don\'t want to get such issue on such an expensive camera, don\'t buy it.", negetive
"My camera broke after only 3 weeks and maybe 200 pictures, handled with tender loving care. Nikon asked me to send it back for repairs. Are you kidding me\! I expect a \$2000 camera to last more than 3 weeks. Luckily I bought it at Costco and was able to get a refund.", negetive
"Purchased a refurbished version thinking that not only that there would be cost savings but that perhaps a body that had been through the refurbish process would have had the dust problem checked and fixed if needed. No such luck \- checked after 4 shots and there were hundreds of spots. Am waiting on return receipt and will return the camera. Just FYI.", negetive
"First some background\:I started getting serious with photography some years ago and bought the D60 after having only Sony Cybershot point and shoots. Needless to say, this was a major step up in image quality, but also required learning more about photographic science.After a couple years. the AF on the D60 started missing auto\-focus more and more, and my choice was either get rid of it, or get it fixed for mucho Do\-Re\-Mi. It wasn\'t awful and most people wouldn\'t even notice, but i\'m a pixel peeper so it was unacceptable to me.I decided to get a new camera, and needed to stay with DX due to budget, and went with the D5100. This was a pretty good upgrade, but, to be perfectly honest I felt something was lacking. I was concerned that my image quality demands had outgrown the DX capabilities \(I am a pixel\-peeper\).After a year or so, i came across some money, and decided to go for it \- I got the D600 and man, this thing is a major step up from DX. The first few shots blew me away. The improvement in clarity of the FX sensor over DX is immediately noticeable. Now I find myself having to get rid of my DX glass and get FX instead, which is slightly painful, but definitely worth it.High\-ISO performance on DX vs. FX is just night and day.Why 1 star\? Well, the oil splatter problem, that\'s a no brainer. I got it cleaned at about 1000 shots and the oil spots have re\-appeared.Nikon made very little effort to appease consumers.", negetive

"I\'ve just bought a D600. After reading the reviews it seems like there have been quite a few issues reported with sensor being dirty \(dust or oil\)\: either right out of the package or after shooting some photos. Probably what\'s happening is excessive oil from moving hinges inside the camera \(shutter\) deposits on the edges of the sensor and then attracts dust. While this shouldn\'t happen out of the box to a high end camera, and Nikon should make modifications during production to minimize the issue, don\'t dispair...For anyone owning a DSLR, I would suggest investing \$50 in sensor cleaning swab\/liquid\/brush kit....Regardless of whether Nikon employees over\-greased the damn levers or not, if you are a heavy use of any camera, learning to clean your sensor periodically will ensure crisp clean photos. It\'s very easy to do. Google \"DSLR sensor cleaning solutions\" and you will see videos of how it\'s done. Very, very, very simple...and you should be set to go....as for voiding the warranty, don\'t be scared...it\'s no different then cleaning your inner mirror or lens...If you put a scratch while cleaning either one of these, you will void the warranty as well...but if you do it carefully and follow basic instructions, you\'ll be fine....I periodically \(every 3\-4 months\) clean the sensors on my cameras. A lot of times I\'ll visually check for dirt\/dust just to make sure I am OK.... In the case of the D600, at worst case scenario, once the excess oils have moved out \(usually happens the more you use the camera\), you\'ll probably not have the issue of constant spotting....and then all you have to do is simply maintain a clean sensor...As for Nikon, they are better off finessing their production line to not over grease the shutters, and they will avoid a lot of insult and refurbishments... it\'s really sad to see their great technology get overshadowed by shoddy workmanship.", negetive
"Even though I really like the features and the image quality of my D600 there is one major issue that spoils the whole thing for me\:After just 2 weeks of normal shooting without even changing lenses there gathered a lot of dust and even oil on the sensor. I got this cleaned by the retailer. After another 2 weeks the dust was there again and I found out that there are many others having the same issue. So I sent back my D600 until there\'s a solution \- or otherwise I\'ll wait for Canon\'s 6D", negetive
"\+1 on the dust spots on my recent purchase here. After one thousand photos, my d600\'s sensor was very dirty. The 24\-70mm was the only lens mounted on this camera and was NEVER unmounted since photo number one. The photos were clean when I first received the camera. My biggest worry is the camera will generate dust spots in mid shoot. I\'m not talking about small specs, these are very noticeable dust spots on the photos at 2.8\; I will recommend my fellow Amazon friends delay the purchase until this problem is resolved.", negetive
"i bought this as a gift for a cousin. The first one arrived broken and had to be returned. the second one arrived and a few days later you advertised this camera at a price \$600 less than I paid. I was told that I could return it but would have to pay a restocking fee of 20 to 50 percent which would wipe out the lower price. I dont think this is a good public relations policy since the camera I received as a replacement of the broken one was received only a few days before the price drop.", negetive
"I was a first adopter and bought my d600 in September 2012.  I like to shoot long exposure which accentuates a dirty sensor  After a month I finally noticed spots\/oil and sent the camera to Nikon for repair and in a week they returned the camera.  The spots\-\-dust, oil, whatever were fainter but still there.  I sent the camera back a second time.  The second return from Nikon also had a dirty sensor.  I sent it back for the third time \(each time with images demonstrating the dust\/oil\).  This time I was given a new camera.  I took the second camera out, shot the sky at f22, ran it through some manipulations and found a dirty sensor\-\-out of the box.  I sent the camera back \(now the fourth time\).  This time Nikon listed a bunch of repairs with it\'s return.  I took the camera out of the box shot the sky at f22\-\-dreaded dust and oil spots appeared.  I sent the camera back \(now the fifth time\) in March 2013 and I just received a check for the amount paid for the camera.  Now I am wanting a full frame sensor camera and simply don\'t trust Nikon.  Just wondering if problems with early iterations of this camera have been repaired in later ones.  People who don\'t shoot long exposure or at small apertures might not notice dust\/oil.  Those who do, will.  BTW, Nikonusers.usa refused my review that pretty much said what I said above.  No rant.  Just facts.  I bought this camera from Amazon but discovered dust problems past return date.  I simply don\'t want to deal with Nikon again where reps appear to talk from talking points, saying you can\'t believe what you read on the internet.  Well I had two cameras with dust\/oil issue that Nikon service couldn\'t clean or repair.  So much for internet as my evidence.", negetive

"I called Nikon several times concerning the oil spatter issue I\'ve been reading in Amazon and other review blogs to see if they corrected the issue.  I\'ve had to leave voice messages because no one seems to pick up their phones or the queues are way too long.  I wanted to purchase a new body as the features of this body sounded excellent except for the oil issue.  Most reviewers have said that they cannot get any feedback from Nikon and that the company has failed to address this issue publicly in any of the camera forums or on their website.I never got any responses back to my calls or my emails.  I see on their site that they just dropped the price of the body below 2K US now.  I guess there are still a lot of bodies on the selves with the issue and they don\'t want to recall them and fix them.  BUYERS BEWARE. If you get a body, chances are you\'ll have weeks or dealing with a really crappy customer service department to get your oil issues resolved.  I\'ll stick with my DX camera and lenses for now.  Been a Nikon user for over 40 years.  It\'s sad to see a quality company put out a defective camera and not conscientiously address it to their fans and users.  It\'s sort of like Toyota and their acceleration issues that they kept denying.My recommendation is don\'t throw your hard earned money into this camera body until Nikon adds up to the issue.", negetive
"Take the Nikon Professional D3x body that sells for \$8,000.00 and put it into a more compact sized body with a few less features and less weight while improving the sensor and making it virtually noise free out to ISO 6400 ...then reduce the price by \$6,000.00 while throwing in an execllent \"walk around lens\" called the Nikon 24\-85mm and there you have it...the amazing Nikon D600\!\!\!I am afraid I must edit my previously glowing review\!The Nikon D\-600 takes the most amazing pictures and the bundled deal with the 24\-85mm lens was amazing especially as it is a new release.The sad sad news...after hitting 1010 pictures my sensor is absolutely loaded with oil\/grease and what appear to be either specs of paint or metal shavings. Something is likely rubbing against something causing vibration that spews oil and then shavings where the two mismatched surfaces collide. It takes 1000\+ photos to finally reveal a HUGE defect\!\!\! I have only had the camera seven or so days and now this.In corresponding with a Nikon tech they informed me that they would pay shipping both ways for a cleaning but the camera would eventually have to be returned for a repair\/fix when the entire scope of the issue finally comes to light. That means Nikon does not know exactly what is happening and therefore does not know what to replace or do. Hence they choose to place us consumers on the \"ignore list\" as sales of unsuspecting customers continue.No way am I sending in a \$2000.00 camera twice when the company does not know what the deal is.... now and possibly later.Shame on Nikon...they should immediately halt production of the D\-600 until they know what\'s wrong and can make a camera that is void of this HUGE defect\!\!\! Have they no shame\?\?\?\?\?\?\?The sensor is the heart of a digital camera and loading it with oil\/grease and possibly metal debris that might not be cleanable is only going to leade to having a camera that is never reliable.Shame on Nikon and Shame on Ken Rockwell for telling us to ignore the issue and just deal with it. The best approach is to stop buying the D\-600 and return the ones that can be returned and then see how fast Nikon gets off their throne and fixes this issue\!Halt production Nikon and focus your efforts on a fix\!\!", negetive
"DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA UNTIL NIKON FIXES DUST\/OIL WIDE SPREAD PRODUCTION PROBLEMSI bought this camera a little over a week ago.I too have the infamous and common dust\/oil problem. \(seems to just be dust for me thankfully\). Anyway, Nikon seems to refuse to acknoledge the problem and says it\'s basically normal.. I know i don\'t have to speak for others \- but this is NOT normal to have to clean your sensor after a few photos.. every few photos..WILD LIFE YOU NEVER NOTICED WHILE SHOOTING CAN APPEAR NEAR THE TOP LEFT CORNER OF YOUR f8\+ LANDSCAPE PHOTOGRAPHY. \;P ..In all seriousness though, this has been a huge headache. I didn\'t buy mine from Amazon, but i\'m posting here to discourage people from buying a product that was not propertly quality assured. I wasn\'t able to return mine so i\'m stuck with it until Nikon acknoledges this. It\'s not fun, and this is a wide spread issue.Otherwise the camera itself is fantastic.

"It probably the best Nikon Camera ever made.  But too bad the QA is not there.  I love this camera but cannot recommend at the moment until all the camera recalled for sensor and possibly vacuum the inside body.To test your camera if having issue like others on the Web.  Please have your aperture at 16 or smaller.  Set it in landscape mode and point at the sky and shoot.  And you too will see how filthy and dirty this camera sensor is.  It need to be cleaned and vacuum the dirt inside the camera body.  You can clean it by your self, but a few hundreds of click, the new dirt will popped up on the sensor.

"I am a newspaper photographer and have had Nikon D200s, D300s, a D700 and \(for my own personal use\) a D800, and have been very happy with these cameras.  I take good care of them and have them cleaned regularly by Nikon Factory Service \(In my opinion, don\'t go anywhere else for service\).  However, the D600 I recently purchased has been a headache right out of the box, that is, noticeable and gradually accumulating dust and OIL SPOTS on the sensor, mostly on the left side of the image \(or the right side of the sensor\).  Nikon has finally \(and Nikon rarely does this\) acknowledged the problem, and they suggest attempting to clean the sensor according to instructions in the camera manual, and if that doesn\'t help, sending it in for factory service.  I suggest skipping trying to clean the sensor yourself.  Send it in to Nikon Factory Service.  I sent mine in two weeks ago and \(interestingly\) the repair is held up because parts need to be ordered and factory service is considering this a major repair.  It sure sounds like they were unable to get the grime of the sensor themselves without major parts replacement.  It is suggested the shutter is throwing lubricating oil, possibly caused by a gap on the side of the shutter mechanism.  I absolutely would not recommend buying this camera at this time.  Do a little research online, and thorougly check your camera.  You may have not noticed the problem because your images are obscuring the spots.  Do a careful test on a uniform surface, such as a wall.  It may help to pop up the contrast a bit on your editing program.  You\'ll discover a lot of buyers have been disappointed because of this problem.  I can\'t imagine anyone even considering purchasing this camera right now.  If Nikon can fix the problem, then they will have a wonderful product.  I am hoping factory service is installing a modified and improved shutter module as well as a new sensor.  Be sure to check your equipment while the camera is under warranty.", negetive
"Spot issue is definitely there and I have started noticing it within about 200 shots on \"upper left\" and \"left center\". They are two pretty big black spots not specks. Agreed I have been able to take care of it using LR... but should I have to use Lightroom, and remove  spots in every picture I click \?Why \? Did I get it for free.. and is that why I should stay quite \? No way.This is my 3rd Nikon body. I loved D90 but moved up to D7000 for better low light capability but D7000 to date has a focus issue that I hate to admit, and of course Nikon never owned up one bit.Now I paid 2K with the 24\-85 lens deal and am shocked and surprised that spot\/dust issue persists. I tried a lot to make up my mind to keep it.. but it\'s getting worse. One spot has turned into two..Is this sealing issue, oil issue.. I din\'t know . I just put on single lens and that has stayed in place.. how could these giant blobs be getting inside my camera\? And of all the places on the sensor \!\!\! \#1 job of camera is to click pics and  if it can\'t click clean pics what can it do \?I will be returning mine and keeping D7000 and this hurts.Some additional thoughts given I am current D7000 user, and just sold my D90 in anticipation of me moving to full frame \:1. D600 really really just feels like a D7000 in mos tregards \(even IQ IMHO\)2. Focus points are all stuck in the middle of the sensor even though the sensor is huge given full frame3. Have see better low light performance in D600 as compared to even D70004. More megapixels are good as you can crop much tighter after the fact.5. Overall my D600 is either overexposing or underexposing at the exact same settings with flash on when compared to D7000, could be a camera specific learning I need to work on, but did not see much IQ improvement I was looking forEdit\:Greeko \- I am now more and more convinced that\:1. Problem is with all D600 units as mine was ordered on Dec 28th, received on Jan 2nd, it took only about 150 pics for nasty spots to show up2. I got suckered into the \"deal\" with the 24\-85 lens, which is no longer available.. in part making it emotionally difficult for me to agree mentally to send the camera and lens \(\+128 GB Card \+ WU\-1b wireless unit\) all for 2K \+ tax.. But the good thing for you is that deal isn\'t available anymore so easy decision. That lens also BTW is only 3.5 \- 4.5 much worse than the 17\-50 2.8 Sigma that I keep on my D7000 all the time.3. I will be keeping my D7000 and 3 othe rlenses that I as about to put on e Bay \- 17\-50mm 2.8 Sigma, 50 1.4 Sigma and Tamron 90mm macro..4. I am clearly disappointed, and pretty shocked at Nikon trying to hide this under the rug.. come on Nikon, own this and we will buy this again and love you like we have for years.. otherwise I am not sure I will be able to keep my years of loyalty intact.5. Technology is advancing, and I really think D90 was the last good camera Nikon produced. Time has come for me to start looking, D7000 is barely acceptable with it\'s focusing flaws. I tried D600 and is being sent back now.When Nikon sold faulty focus D7000s and I said it\'s bad people told me \"it\'s higher level camera.. your technique must be wrong.. blah blah blah\" but in the case of D600 there is not a single person who I know owns this camera \(3 of my friends\/colleagues\) who have not had the spots start showing up sooner than later, and we all know what is an acceptable speck of dirt vs really bad blotchy spots.. And given I keep my eye glasses shiny with the glass wipes all day, I can\'t stand this crapola.", negetive
"I have taken 3,000 actuations with the D600 and have been pleased with the quality of the images. From the beginning I noticed the dirty sensor issue but since I usually shoot with the aperture mid to wide open this has not been a major issue.A few days ago, I was taking pictures of my 4 year old son at an indoor event. I noticed my autofocus was not working. After playing around with my settings for about an hour and still not getting a picture in focus without manually adjusting the lens, I went to my local camera shop. In retrospect, I should have purchased the camera at my local shop because of the follow up service. The salesman at the camera store played with the camera for a few minutes and tried a couple of their lenses. He said the autofocus mechanism appeared to be broken and I would need to send the camera back to Amazon.I spoke with Amazon and they said I would need to contact Nikon directly because I purchased the product over 30 days ago \(September 29\). I called Nikon and they gave me the address for their returns center and the procedures for the return. They said it is my responsibility to pay for shipping. I said I thought they should pay since the autofocus should not have broke and the sensor should not be getting oil spots on it. Bottom line, the customer service has been poor. They told me several times \(after playing the I need to check with my manager game\) that they would send me a label for free shipping. It has never come \- after repeated calls with their customer service department over two days. Nikon customer service is nice on the phone but NEVER follow through with what they say they will do.I told the Nikon customer service agent that I have bought two cameras and over \$10,000 in Nikon equipment over the last 4 years, and, as a matter of principle, they should pick up the cost of shipping my camera for repair. They must have some type of internal program to wear down customers to minimize their costs. Here is what I learned\:1. Be careful of being an early adopter of technology. I should have waited 6 months for thorough reviews of the camera.2. If buying new technology, buy the equipment at a local camera shop. They will give you better service as they have a strong incentive to please their local customers.3. Nikon does not do a good job with customer service. They are behind the times in this area and do not understand how to build a relationship with their customers.Well, I will be shipping my camera UPS this morning to the Nikon Repair Center and paying the shipping costs. Nikon you win. Your strategy was successful.", negetive
"The \"dust particle\" problem with the D600 sensor, which is actually a \"shutter lubricant splatter\" problem is completely beyond excuse. How did that slip by Quality Control. The build\-up on the sensor gets worse over time, and makes the camera completely unusable. My recommendation is Do Not Buy This Camera until Nikon issues a recall and fixes the problem on existing cameras and on all new ones in production.", negetive
"I am disappointed Amazon will not return the item for its sensor defect. The 30 day return policy should not apply here since I did like the camera for the first month \- and it was only until I found out after 30 days that there is a fundamental problem with the lens dust\/oil. It would be like buying a car that drives well at certain hours of the day and then not being able to return it because you hadn\'t tested it at midnight when the wheels fall off.", negetive
"D600 Serial Number\: 3069\*\*\*I thought Nikon would have resolved the dust and oil problem by now. I had high hopes for this super light weight FX body. I purchased the D600 on March 1, 2013 and returned it on March 5.The Good\: Very light weight FX body. I could not tell the difference in weight compared to my D7000.The Bad\: Very large amounts of debris located on the left side of the frame within the fist 100 clicks.  I was only shooting at f\/5.6. I blew the debris off the sensor with ease using a rocket blower. Smaller dust was noted between 200\-300 clicks followed by another blow off the sensor. There was very little dust noted after 600 clicks at f\/22. No dust was noted after 600 clicks at f\/22 on a blue sky. I was feeling very lucky and happy. Then at around 850 clicks the much talked about oil residue began to appear in the top left corner along with small dust particles.The dust problems occur within the body. The only time I removed the 50 mm prime lens was when I blew the junk off the sensor. After the sensor was clean I would perform an f\/22 blue sky test to make sure the sensor was spotless.", negetive
"I have had the D600 for 3 days now. I got it with the Nikkor 70\-200m f\/2.8G VR II and have taken just over 1000 shots so far, all in the beautiful snow of the NY finger lakes. I have owned several DSLR\'s and SLR\'s before, but this is my first full frame DSLR. The photos with this wonderful camera and this fantastic lens are magical. I am still really a brand new user of the D600 and will update my review when I really put it through its paces, but I just wanted to post this quick impression because I am so delighted. Also I have tested to see if I have oil on the sensor problem with the shots I have taken in the pure white snow covering most of the frame, at f\/2.8, and I cannot find a single flaw of this nature. I am using Lightroom 4.3 to view and adjust my NEF images. Reports suggest this is an out of the box problem, so I will hopefully not have this problem. I did also get the kit lens and I have tried it and its OK. I will be replacing it with the Nikkor 24\-70 f\/2.8G shortly. I also have the Nikkor 50mm f\/1.8G which is absolutely excellent and I look forward to using it with this full frame camera. I did also get the wireless adapter with the camera which works well enough and will be useful under some circumstances. Overall I am delighted with the D600 and although I was prepared to return it in favor of the D800 if it did have the oily sensor problem, it does not. I recommend this camera to anyone who wants a full frame DSLR. Do be prepared, as I was, to buy the fantastic FX glass that Nikon makes. I highly recommend taking advantage of the discount offered by Amazon in buying such lenses at the time of purchase of the camera. Also look out for the special offers like free SD card and backpack. I did not see this offer and did not add the free items to my cart, so missed out. Not a biggie since I have 95mb\/s SD cards and an incredible case in the form of the ThinkTank Sling\-o\-matic\/30. My review is to be continued and I look forward to testing out the video even though this is secondary for me.Update\: 12\/29\/12OK, I took more shots at f\/14 to f\/22, again with the Nikkor 70\-200mm f\/2.8G VRII. With a white background I DO have dark spots in the same places on every shot. These are clearly caused by sensor contamination. Out of the box the camera cap has been off no more than 6 seconds for 2 lens changes. This is unacceptable for a brand new \$2000 camera. I will be returning it to Amazon as a defective unit and will change to the D800.Update\: 12\/31\/12I just want to close off this review by saying that Amazon have been very good regarding the return of this camera. Of course they are paying for return shipping on the camera, but they are also paying for the return shipping of accessories I bought for the camera, supplied by other companies. They are not required to do this but have agreed to do so without hesitation. I have already ordered the D800 and it arrives on Jan 2nd. This camera had better not have any left\-wide focus issues or I will drop Nikon and sell all of my lenses. Good luck to those who stick with the D600 and start cleaning the sensor of an out of the box camera. A great camera that will eventually be produced with the levels of quality expected.Update 1\/13\/13I received my D800 to replace this D600 10 days ago. All I can say is thank god the D600 was faulty. I would have never tried the D800 and for about \$700 more it is superior is almost every aspect. Sure the memory cards cost more and it will eat up your disk space faster, but in every way that matters to me the D800 blows the D600 to pieces. I may well write an extensive review of the D800 but to be honest its all already been said. I love Nikon again and paired with the holy trinity lens set plus a few choice primes, the D800 is the best non\-sports DSLR money can buy.", negetive
"Upgrading from D90 so the viewfinder is nice and big in comparison.  The noise performance at low light is good too.  Overall, what you\'d expect a full frame camera to be until you start using it and wondering why they decided to do certain things the way they do.More seriously, I have not found a way to change the aperturewhile in video mode even when not shooting.  This is a serious flaw.  The D800 does it and I don\'t think this should be something that\'s left out on purpose if they want a serious video camera.  I have to switch back to photography mode, pick the aperture, then switch back to video mode and start shooting.  If the conditions change while shooting, you\'re SOL.I was also annoyed at how the AF doesn\'t lock in when there is still plenty of light\/contrast in the scene when using a flagship f\/2.8 Nikkor lens.  If the subject is close, it\'s not a big deal because the AF assist light kicks in, but for things like concerts or weddings where you have to stay at a distance and it\'s low light, you\'re SOL again.Furthermore, the AF points are clustered in the center.  This is annoying but I could make it work, just leaves more wiggle room in the rule of thirds.As for the Oil issue, it\'s too early for me to check but this is a serious concern and I hope Nikon comes out and addresses it.  Man up Nikon.  Public Relations do matter.Less serious, why did they reverse the zoom in and zoom out buttons than previous generations\?\*\*\*update \#1 after 2 days of owning\*\*\*\*\*I wanted to make sure my review of the focus system was fair so last night and tonight, on this holiest of weekends \(Halloween\), I took the camera out to a few bars and clubs.  This time I had an SB\-800 flash on the camera which means that the camera uses the flash\'s Auto\-Assist matrix light.  Again, the camera failed to lock in focus on any other point except for the center.  Again, I was using the Nikkor 24\-70mm f\/2.8 \(a freaking \$1900 pro lens\).  I don\'t think I can really trust this camera too much in low light which is sad considering I got a full frame camera for low light.  The AF system is severely lacking in this camera.Another problem I found is the LCD screen is larger but very poor. I guess it\'s better that pictures in the back look worse than on the computer since in the past it was the other way around with my Nikons but I just can\'t trust this camera very much during these situations.\*\*\*update \#2\*\*\*I had 3 very different shoots yesterday.  One was at a professional sports arena pretty close to the court.  Using the 85mm f\/1.8, the AF was very good.  No issues at all.Shoot \#2 was in day light shooting at ISO 100.  Again, everything was beautiful.Shoot \#3, at a dark museum.  On some items \(very large well lit\) exhibits, it was fine, but as soon as there was anything with a reflection, the lens failed.  this was mostly with my 80\-200mm f\/2.8 AF\-D lens.Another thought, RAW files are HUGE on this \- damn near 30 MB...\*\*\*\*\*Update \#3\*\*\*\*Hold everything.  I found 10 oil spots on my sensor.  At first I thought it was 3, but it\'s all over the place mostly around the left and top.  What a piece of garbage.Update \#4Nikon is not answering emails, phones, nor tweets. Nice.Update \#5Nikon finally decided to answer their phone. Smuggy woman who answered the phone said there were no widespread problems with the D600 and told me not to believe my own eyes nor the eyes of many others.  She ignored all the links and sample pictures I sent and refused to send a shipping label.  All she offered was to send me to a link to send the camera in but then I\'d have to pay for shipping.  6 pounds, across the country, fully insured is about \$60.  I\'m sending it to BH now to see if the replacement will work.Update \#6, BH \(which has GREAT customer service by the way in case amazon doesn\'t work out for you for various reasons \*cough\* sales tax\) Sent me the replacement and that too had dust.Before sending it back to Nikon, I gave the replacement a dusting with the blower rocket and also canned air and it looked as if it blew most of the dust away.  This time at least it was only dust.\*\*Final update\*\*It is now 4\-19\-2013 and I have owned this camera since October of 2012.  So all in all, it\'s been 6 months.Throughout this time I\'ve had to clean the sensor 3 times.  1st time I did it myself, 2nd time I sent it in, and last time I just blew compressed air and it got everything.  That\'s just a fact of life with this camera.  I wish it wasn\'t, but it is and it seems like the dust issue becomes a minor thing after the initial cleanings.  I am also not happy that you can\'t change the aperture in live view mode.For the photographs however, this camera is superb.  Often in the past I would have to use fill flash in many situations just to try to balance light out but with this camera, the dynamic range is so high that I get away with lifting the shadows later.  The ISO performance is also insane.  I don\'t give using ISO 6400 a second thought.Final \(really final\) updateIt is now November 2013. The dust is still here and gotten worse.  It never goes away, it\'s like sensor herpes.  Nikon still hasn\'t admitted problems but they fixed the problems that don\'t exist by rolling out with the D610.  Thanks for nothing, Nikon.", negetive
"Returned my one today.  It was a good camera until taking around 200 shots.  I love its D7000 style 39 focus points\; I love nikon low light sensor performance\; I love the light weight and awesome size\; but I have no choice to say goodbye to D600 due to dust, dust, and dust on the sensor.  It\'s not easy to stand on a \$2000 camera with on going increasing internal dust.  Yes, report saying dust will reduce after takin more than 3000 shots, but I cannot see the reason to suffer 3000 shots for the dust reducing.  What\'s the point to pay \$2000 camera with sensor dust issue and Nikon didn\'t take any action or have any plan to fix it.", negetive
"This camera is a great one except for one critical problem\: the sensor gets filled of dust in few hundred pictures, seems like that something is exfoliating inside the camera and matter ends up in the sensor, google for it and you will see how many complains\!", negetive
"I was very disappointed with a few major components.First, I found the on\/off switch is difficult to activate. It is necessary to use a finger nail. What about those poor people who chew their nails...good luck.Second, I was surprised to see that the 5X zoom seemed less especially since the C360 I have used for years could digitized what seems to be twice the distance.Third, I would have asked for my money back, but the penalty was too severe.", negetive
"I had a kodak camera that was only 2 years old, but got sand in the lense, so bought this new one.It is a kodak easyshare c195. In the picture it appeared to be red metallic in color, when in fact it is a flat ugly maroon.The casing is plastic, not metal like my other one \( which I think cheapens it\)It makes an annoying repeating clicking noise when it is turned on.The shutter speed is horrendously slow, along with the zoom feature.It may be 14 mp. vs. my 8 on my old kodak, but I\'d take my old one over this one any day.It feels like a cheap disposable camera.I wish I had bought from ebay because at least I would\'ve gotten my money back with the buyer protection with paypal.BIG FAT WASTE OF \$100.00 hard earned dollars.", negetive

"Had the mailers just tested this camera before they sent it to me, I would not have had to send it back. It is like Russian roulette to get a good C195. I went and got a used C875 from a reputable seller and it works for me. There are so many good things that this camera could have done...except it had a hair trapped inside the lense and it made for a rainbow across every image. Also the case felt like a pepsi can. It was too light and had a fragile feeling. Plus the zoom created a blurred image so that was a killer for this cam. I got all my money back. Thanks.", negetive

"This is without reservation, the WORST camera that I have ever purchased\! I previously owned 2 Kodak \"point and shoot\" digital cameras and loved them both. This one, however, is impossible to use. The pictures are great, but trying to download them to your computer is a nightmare\! Using either the card or internal memory, I couldn\'t get my pics downloaded to at least 2 different editing programs that I commonly use. I called \"Customer Support\" and spent ALMOST AN ENTIRE DAY \"chatting\" with them and yet, they couldn\'t solve my problem. Obviously, this was NOT operator error\! They were patient, but MY patience ran out the longer the \"chat\" went on. Late in the afternoon, I was exhausted and asked that an agent call me in the morning. They said that they COULD NOT make outbound calls, even considering the lengthy discussion that we already had\!\!\!\! Speaking of the memory card, when you attempt to get it out of the camera, the batteries fall out and by the way, the camera eats batteries, BIG time. The on\/off switch is difficult to use \(it\'s sort of recessed\) and you can only date your pic AFTER you\'ve taken it\! There is NO user manual. You have to read it on line and if you want something to have in your hand, you need to print it yourself, ALL 67 Pages\! I\'m sure that I\'ve forgotten something about this awful camera but you get the idea. These are just some of the low lights\! Save yourself a lot of grief and BUY SOMETHING ELSE.

So when you read their product description telling you that it has \"date stamping\", remember that you have to do it yourself\-\-manually\-\-for each picture. \(Incidentally, even their own on\-line instructions for this model provide you pictures of a menu for setting automatic date stamping.

Not at all sure what the purpose of the cable is...it doesn\'t charge the camera, and it\'s not necessary to transfer the pictures.

"Kodak EasyShare c195 has more pixels and a little bit nicer looks than my old c663. I accidentally dropped c663 a few times, but nothing breaked off the camera, and the electronic components were last for 6 years. I was happy for that. For c195, I thought it must be better because it is newer version. Unfortunately, it was last for 3 months. The door that cover battery was loosen, popping out while shooting. I was going to return but no luck. The last time I was taking a picture then the battery door opened again, and that cause the camera slipped off my hand dropped to the ground. Two pieces of the camera frames, the top covered and the tiny function bottons came off. They looked alike pieces of  cheap toys that connecting to each others by the tiny latches on the edges. I managed them back in place. The three little buttons, flash, mode, and power are working but the shutter button is not working. Now, I can not return it because I do not have an insurance and no idea how to get it repair. It is better if they make the frame of c195 like c663.

"I compared this to the Olympus camera that was a similar price. Due to this camera\'s slightly lower price and good reviews, I bought it. It is going into the trash as soon as I get my new Olympus. This camera has trouble focusing. Most photos I take are blurry, even after allowing it time to bring the focusing box on screen. You can\'t just shoot a picture, you have to coax it out of the camera. Taking many photos with the flash is a slow process. The camera misfires frequently so you end up with lots of black photos. When the flash does work, it only barely lights a room. On 90\% of my interior shots I have to lighten the photos in a computer software program. There is no way I have found to adjust the Fstop as there is in the Olympus so you are at the mercy of it\'s auto adjust to everything and it\'s not too picky about getting things lit or focused. The viewfinder has an adjustment so you can lighten what you see there, but then you aren\'t getting what you see on the viewfinder\! The viewfinder may show a light photo but after you download it you realize it\'s very dark. What good is that\?I use this to photo houses I work on and it\'s a pain. I\'ll never buy another cheap Kodak camera again\!", negetive

"The camera had terrible latency issues.I would throw it in the garbage if I was unable to return it.I turn it on. The screen comes on. I set the date and time.I try to activate the zoom. I seems not to work, about 3\-4 seconds later the zooming occurs.I press the button to take a picture... nothing. I press again and, click, picture taken. I try to uses the thumb pad to delete the picture, no response. The screen goes black. At this point the camera is totally non\-responsive.I press the power button to turn it off, but the lens stays open for about 10 seconds before it goes off.This is the second Kodak camera I have purchased that has been dysfunctional to the point of being useless.Fool me once... you know the rest.", negetive
"Would NOT recommend product...it came without a memory card.  Has internal storage for 10 pictures.  What good is a camera that takes only ten pictures\?  I will be contacting Kodak about this problem and if I am not satisfied I shall return it ASAP.", negetive
"This camera software will not work on any of my computers and when you check on line with Kodak it says they no longer offer downloads or tech support for this product. I should have known better I already bought one of their printers. The wifi never works and although the ink is cheap you run out after very few prints.", negetive
"I am very disapointed, because the camera came with a damaged lens, and I don\'t know what to do now.", negetive
"I bought this camera for my 9 year old son. We got it and installed the batteries included and it didn\'t work. We used fresh batteries and it didn\'t work. We\'re returning it.", negetive
"I have a part time job as a lister to earn some extra cash which requires me to take numerous photographs with a digital camera. One of the camera\'s is the Easyshare C195. I have an old 1megapixel A10 Canon that not only takes better pictures than the C195, it\'s far less frustrating.  My biggest complaint with the C195 is the fact that the camera never seems to focus on the object you are shooting, but the wall or a random space. The pictures at times look clear on the screen, but once downloaded are very blurry. I have never seen a camera take so many out of focus pictures. I had to take a picture of a Coach bag from every angle. I took 47 pictures of the front of the bag in our staging area. Not a single one of them was in focus. The camera also likes to apply some yellow filter at times to ruin pictures. I\'ve also noticed that if battery life is less than 50\%, the camera will not download pictures to the pc but rather an error will display.", negetive
"after using camera 5 times lens does not retract, I,m stucked with a brand new camera I can not use.", negetive
"I hate this camera\!  It doesn\'t work with Mac and they have no support\!  Don\'t waste your money.  You suck Kodak\!  I will never buy your products again.", negetive
"I guess you do get what you pay for, but the \$79 for this camera was overpriced. So many things wrong with it\:1.  I ordered the blue, which was lovely in the product picture. When I opened the box, I swore\: they sent me a black one instead. Wrong. Upon microscrutinizing it, it was dark, dark, DARK blue. Barely \'blue.\'2.  The function \'buttons\' are made for Lilliputians with tiny fingers. Very hard to depress with a normal\-sized finger.3.  The package does not include an instructional guide, just a tiny foldout thing with very scant info in 4 different languages.4.  To view the guide you have to log on to an internet site. Shameful that a decent quick\-guide couldn\'t be included to carry around.5. This camera is supposed to be able to be set for sepia and black \& white photos. On the online guide it tells you which buttons to click, and the color setting is one function under a menu category called \'Capture.\' The guide has around 7 or 8 selections under Capture\: the camera has three, and color is not one of them.6.  The transference from the camera to the PC is not as one\-step as the Canon, and you have to click on several options to get to where you can upload.Kodak\: uh uh \- never again.", negetive
"What a nightmare\!First impression... wow that is one heavy digital camera\! It takes forever for picture to get stored to memory card once you snap your picture. My memory card has speed of 4, which is standard memory card speed and my other cameras store it in 1 second. Next thing that sucks is that you have to hold you hand still when you take pictures or they will come out blurry. If you use flashlight your pictures will most of the time come out blurry. Video quality sucks really bad, it\'s all grainy like ancient old tv picture quality with snow in it. The sound in the video is really bad as well. Can\'t even compare with my 10 year old digital camera by sony. I tried to connect it to computer to upload pictures but it would never turn on. It was always like this since I purchased it. I had to put in memory card in my other camera to be able to upload pictures on pc. If you want headache and problems in your life.. this is the camera for you\!", negetive
"I have and still use my 35mm auto\/manual focus FILM camera. I love it, despite the length to see my results. I got this camera to capture and share holiday moments of me and my 4 year old.As I see that most reviews were posted over 2 years ago, I\'m an idiot for wasting my money on this piece of ....All but 2 of my first pics were blurry.Then \"Easyshare\" is not so easy. There is no longer any software to download to even set up the sharing options.All of the links I click on, sends me to \"contact support\" and \"sorry for the inconvenience.\"I\'m so glad I tested it before I took irreplaceable photos. But both Amazon and kodak need to take these off the market or be honest upfront.", negetive
"One star is all this one is definitly worth\!  I only had this camera a month and then it turn to a piece of crap\!", negetive
"This would not be a bad camera if you just want to take pictures of the family around the house.  For anything much beyond that, its not very good. It may actually be one of Kodak\'s worse. The buttons are tiny, in a crevice and not easy to use unless you can look at the camera in the light. You will never be able to turn the camera on quickly for a spontaneous photo. Not really all that big of a deal since it won\'t capture a quick picture anyway. The delay from the time you press the button to take the picture and the camera records it is so long that many subjects will not even be in the picture. Tried to take pics of the Air Force Thunderbirds, the only way possible is to \'snap\' the picture before the planes are even within the camera\'s viewfinder.  Then many times, it will blur a picture anyway. Turning the flash on and off, too difficult. Cannot turn flash on by the push of a button \(it will only go to auto\) you have to go to the programs. The program menu takes a while to navigate so you may lose a picture while trying to find a workable setting. And if the camera goes into auto shut off, you have to go through the whole programing thing again because it will come back on in auto only. All in all, the worse I have ever had and I have always been a huge Kodak fan. Don\'t have any idea what they were thinking of but this is a huge disappointment. Again, for a planned family event or some thing similar, probably good enough. For capturing special unplanned moments, you will just be disappointed.", negetive
"Not even 30 days passed and the lens mechanism was stuck in the open position.  Can\'t do anything else with it.  Need to contact the seller regarding how to warranty this item.  Won\'t buy this brand again, that\'s for sure.", negetive
"The camera would be a great choice but, no sd card,\? come on give us a breakUntil Kodak believes in customer satisfaction buy the sd card together during purchase.", negetive
"I ordered this Camera because it was Purple and I had been using an older Kodak EasyShare for several years that I had never had an issue with.  This Camera will not work more than a few mins and you have to replace the batteries.", negetive
"I was disappointed with this Kodak Camera. If you lower the megapixels by half the picture becomes grainy amd the colors become too pale. I had always owned an EasyShare camera, but this time I am completely dissapointed by the quality of this product.", negetive
"Pros\: it\'s cheap and not bad quality.Cons\:Well.. The quality of the handling. I didn\'t expect I would get a defective product. As soon as I opened it, the screen was cracked.", negetive
"I purchased this camera 12\/17\/10 and thought I was getting a great deal at \$80.  Wanted to replace my 5 yr old Kodak Easyshare that didn\'t have an LCD display and was 4MP.  This camera at 14MP takes the same quality pictures, no difference.  Another issue is that the batteries were dead in 2 days, sent by Kodak with the camera, with very little use, less than 20 photos taken.  My older Kodak could use the same batteries for 3 wks\!  Also, the controls are difficult to navigate without using a fingernail and low light situations take poor photos, there\'s some type of delay for the flash and then you loose your shot.  Another issue is that it states takes SDHC cards but these cards have to be formatted, unlike regular SD cards and if you take the SDHC card out you have to go to the trouble of reformatting again.  SDHC card was not recognized when I tried to upload photos, whereas any SD card that I used in the camera was no problem uploading.  Also, didn\'t like the fact that there\'s no viewfinder for outside photos, in addition to LCD screen and you have to date stamp each photo that you take instead of just setting the date once and the date appearing on all photos you take unless you remove that option.  Took the camera back to the store and will use my old camera for awhile longer.", negetive
"The price of this camera even being so low is still way too high for this piece of junk. I haven\'t even been able to take it out and use it yet and it\'s already fallen apart... Do not buy this\!", negetive
"I was unable to figure out how to use this camera even though I owned a esay share kodak camera previouslyI was unable to get help off of the kodack easy share help line eitherI want to return it", negetive
"will not load software to my computer.  even got software disk\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!  would like help to make camera or memory card work.  THANK YOU\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!", negetive
"Bought this camera thinking the price was low, kodak was a great household brand and the AA alkaline battery option would obviate the need for home battery recharging. Also it is easy to carry an extra pair of AA batteries. To my shock and dismay, the batteries died after taking about 10 photos the first time I used it and that too while in the midst of an important home function photo\-taking session. Thought the battery was bad and replaced with a new set of batteries and same thing happened again. Used to have a cannon camera with a rechargable lithuim battery before this camera that served me well for many years. Now I am trying out rechargeable AA battery for the Kodak camera. Hopefully I will have more luck.", negetive
"camera did not work lens would not open so I was not allowed to use the camera. I also was not satisfied with the color I had to change colors when I ordered another one.", negetive
"On\-line with Kodak now .... the agent is telling me that this camera does not come with the easyshare software but with the sharebutton app. The camera will only transfer photos to my computer using this. THE ISSUE IS THAT MY COMPUTER DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE FRIGGIN\' CAMERA\!I bought this today and am taking it back TOMORROW\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!", negetive
"We gave this to my daughter for Christmas, but here we are \-\- in mid March and the camera is broken.  Didn\'t even last 4 months.  We\'re so disappointed, as is she.  Received lens error, now massive clicking sounds.  This one is a mess.  Wouldn\'t recommend.", negetive
"My Canon Powershot camera was \$59. I needed a cheap camera fast and I got mine within two days. The charger plugged directly into the wall with a place for the battery to sit. So far so good. But unlike all other cameras I have bought, it did not even come with a starter memory card. When I took a picture, it told me \"Cannot Record.\"  And there was no USB cable to connect to my computer either. That\'s a new one for me too.I repeat there is no memory card and no USB cord, so you can neither take a picture nor view it.But it did say in the book that there was a \"\*power cord,\"\(asterisk included\) written in smaller font on the starter page under Package Contents. But there was no such thing. Then under the first step, \"Charging the Battery, \" it tells you to, \"Plug the power cord into the charger, then plug the other end into a power outlet.\" I was able to charge my battery without this power cord. It was only by using a powerful light that I could see that on the back of my battery charger was the model number inscribed as CB\-2LF, and I did not need this power charger. Such needless aggravation.I have a wee website in which I am Amazon affiliate and I was going to write a review. But it looks like that will have to wait until the add\-ons I ordered today come in. So much for trusting Amazon to give me the full low\-down. It should come with a huge caution sign for buyers, especially at this price. These things do add up. How can you make a price\/feature comparison if you have to calculate so many variables\? Furthermore, a camera at this price, might be  for a gift, and the gift recipient would be pretty bummed if they had to order additional items just to make the Canon Powershot A2500 work.The bigger problem will be when I get the memory card and the proper USB cord, what happens if I don\'t like the picture of the camera or how it functions\? Will the aftermarket companies allow me to send back their products and get a refund that includes the shipping cost\? It would have been so much more convenient for Canon to sell a complete package.I guess  learned my lesson. The product description on Amazon gave the features of the camera. But it did not list what came in the box. I should have read through each review and customer Q \& A to glean what was still needed to make this camera fully operable.If this were a car it would be missing its steering wheel, and other car stuff, which I can\'t think of the analogies, because I am so frustrated.But there are three nice things I can tell you\: The cherry red is easy to spot in a dark purse and it is very, very light weight. And one kind person on this site Ricky Lorda, answered my question about the USB from the ask customer section of this page, saying that it did come with a USB cord \(although as I mentioned, mine did not\), and that was very nice of him to give me his quick response.", negetive
"There was no memory card that fit it\! I went to Walmart to find it and it still doesn\'t work\!", negetive
"Very disappointed in customer service. The camera said it came with free SD card and free case but when I received it there was no SD card or case so I called and they said I was suppose to click on learn more and then check those items but it said it cost for those items so I didn\'t click on them cause I thought I was getting them free. When I called customer service said they could not send the SD card or case. Very misleading, I\'m a very good customer but that didn\'t matter. So I would not buy this item for that reason.", negetive
"Took this camera to Disneyland and it kept freezing and had lines going through it so the pictures didnt turn out very well. Really want to return.", negetive
"I purchased this Canon based upon reviews found on the web.  I compared the picture quality by using 2 cameras taking the exact same picture at the exact same time then comparing the results.  The other camera was my Canon SX110 purchased in 2008.  I was looking for a \"better\" camera, more pixels, better resolution...  Not nearly as good and I wanted better.  I wouldn\'t recommend this for kids to use as a toy.", negetive
"It was cheap and not at all like my previous camera.  I returned it and will be ordering a different model  Customer service was great however.", negetive
"Bought this camera during Thanksgiving. the product was shipped later than the agreed date ..the deal came with the case and 16gb card. I did not receive the card and case I was promised..I ordered this camera for the sd card offered for the low price....I could have purchased sony wx710 instead for the same price. very flimsy tooo...planning to return", negetive
"Do not like camera...photos are not up to par from less expensive older one.  Will not use it again.  Will keep it strictly as emergency backup but not happy about it.", negetive
"Purchased in late Sep 2013, on a trip in Jan, the lens motor jammed.  Now it doesnt focus. You can hear a  motor inside constantly trying to do something. OUt of focus now. Zooms in and out, but wont focus.Second cannon product that has broken on me. Will be my last. Amazon return said my window has closed. So guess I\'m out of luck.", negetive
"Have not used it enough to really rate this product and I keep taking pictures of myself which is really weird.", negetive
"I bought this camera and it eats batteries like crazy.  I might be able to take 5 pictures and then it needs new batteries.  It should be rechargeable.", negetive
"The camera that I received does not work. The image is totally blurred on the screen, probably a CCD issue. It is useless.", negetive
"Pictures are blurry and unfocused when the zoom is used. If you use the flash there are big blotches in your picture. I\'m really sorry I bought this camera.", negetive
"It appears to be a nice little camera. BUT, it comes with no USB cord, no memory card, AND NO MANUAL. You can download a 119 page manual from the Canon Web site.  If your tech challenged forget it. This was the first digital camera I ever purchased. When I opened the box there was no disc for my computer. I\'m not one to download info from a web site. So I decided to return it. In my case it would be best for me to go to a camera store and get personal  advice form a sales person.", negetive
"I am suppose to get a case and a memory card with my order of the A2500. 16mp digital camera with 5x optical image stabilized", negetive
"I\'m so embarrassed \- no memory card and gave as a present.  Now buying a memory card which changes the whole deal.. Cheep decision by cannon.  You suck", negetive
"The three item package proved to be useful.  I am not able to check on photos I have taken only when I have attached it to my computer then I can see the photos.  I am working on that.  Nice and easy to handle.", negetive
"after waiting 7 days to receive my camera, there was no memory card or power cord inside and it was useless. if I know I would order memory card, but there was no mention to that in the description info \!\!", negetive
"This camera is not user friendly. I had to keep resetting the date, the flash never stayed on which is a pain in the ass and it took 5\+ seconds for the shot to be taken. Too bad Kodak went of biz. I still prefer their easyshare camera.", negetive
"This is a horrible product and when I called Canon support I was told \"Well we didn\'t sell it to you\" \!\!\!\?", negetive
"CRAP.  DEFECTIVE.  MISSING PARTS.  NOT GOOD AT ALL.  ALWAYS HAD CANON.  WILL RETHINK MY DECISION.  IN PROCESS OF SENDING IT BACK FOR MY RFUND.", negetive
"I researched this camera very carefully before ordering.Canon stated that it was compatible with Windows Vista.Well, it wasn\'t.Canon blamed it on MS Silverlight.I have never dealt with such a hostile, arrogant tech support.I thought that this would be plug and play like every other digital cameras I have purchased.One completely frustrating, waste of time experience.Grateful that Amazon made the return an easy experience.Even the Canon feedback e\-mail was awful and consistent with this poor experience.It got to 99\% and it wouldn\'t complete loading.My 1st and last Canon product\!", negetive
"I had the camera for about 6 months and it quit working.  I sent it back to Canon and they said my warranty is null and void because I bought it from Amazon.  I couldn\'t believe it\!  They don\'t warranty the largest retailer in the world\!  Also,  I left the Wausabi battery in the camera, so they could see it was charged.  My warranty was again null and void because I used a Wausabi battery recommended by Amazon.  They must really  hate Amazon\!", negetive
"It was working fine at the beginning, but it\'s zoom lens pulled out and can\'t turn on the camera after that.I don\'t think I cannot fix it, and I did not buy the guarantee so I don\'t think I could get reimburse.", negetive
"The low light capabilities are not good at all. The shutter speed lags significantly and if I were taking pictures of my little nephews or dormmates being silly, the pictures would all come out blurry. The turn\-on time was slower than expected. Half a second makes a big difference in my opinion. The camera took too long to focus and often times did not focus on the proper subject. I did only take shots in my dorm room, but the lights were on. Maybe if I took pictures in the daytime outdoors, the quality of the pictures would have been better.The color is a very nice red and it was very light and small, but it felt so cheap because of the plastic shell. I returned it and bought the Canon Elph 330, which I like a heck of a lot better.Would not recommend or buy again.", negetive
"It takes nice pictures but I\'m a little disappointed that it doesn\'t have a timer for group photos. Good size. Needed to purchase memory card separate.", negetive
"This unit has never operated correctly.  after installing new batteries and different memory cards, it always came up with an error of no memory or memory full when these cards were brand new and never used.", negetive
"It said it comes with a free case and 16g sd card, non of it came with it, was a plain simple lie by Amazon, anything I can do now\?", negetive
"This is the worst camera I have ever purchased.  Regardless which setting is used, every picture ends up blurry \(even still shots\).", negetive
"Despite charging the battery until it stated that it was fully charged \(Green Light\) and inserting the battery properly the camera will not turn on after pressing the on\-off button.The camera that was shipped \(that was also shipped late despite having Amazon Prime\) is defective.", negetive
"I am very disappointed with the Canon company. We purchased this very same camera over a year ago, but we lost it in Italy. This version does not come with a memory card or the cable needed to download images.So cheap of Canon\!\!\! The camera does a great job of taking pictures. But that\'s all you get from this version.Our original purchase had lots of bells and whistles on the camera and all the required accessories. This version only let\'s you have normal or low format pictures. We did not purchase this from Amazon, but I do not expect that you would get the needed accessories where ever you decide to purchase this product.", negetive
"I bought this because I had a PowerShot and lost it.  No instruction booklet, just a piece of paper that unfolded.  The cord to attach to pc was not in the box so I used my old one.  Could not download pictures.  Camera kept shutting off.  This updated version is awful.", negetive
"I was very disappointed with this purchase. I formerly had the A3300 which was definitely much better then the A2500. It shuts off if you don\'t take a picture right away, the image stabilization \(which is one of the reasons I purchased this camera\) is horrible the picture is always blurry or out of focus and the Auto feature is slow to pick up anything or won\'t change to the correct feature.I would not recommend this camera to anyone and wish that I had gotten a different camera.", negetive
"What is the purpose of selling an item that doesn\'t work right out of the box\? I really have to buy an additional item just to be able to use this camera\? I wonder how long a car dealership would stay in business if after the sale, the customer was told they needed to buy the tires because it wasn\'t part of the original sale, THIS IS BS\!", negetive
"The first one I got was a DOA, there is no user\'s manual and no power cable \-\- instruction book says the power cable is included..", negetive
"Worthless. Am sending it back. You have to charge the battery every time. I charged this Camera on Sunday. Took 3 pictures and the battery is dead. On Christmas Day. I would give this camera a Big Fat Zero\!", negetive

"NO instruction on how the camera works in box.  The battery base charger pulls right into wall very dangerous.  The camera seem cheap made.", negetive
"I bough the PowerShot A2500 for my wife for Christmas and within 1 1\/2 months the LCD screen got all distorted.When I sent it in to Canon they tried to say that the camera was dropped. The camera was never mistreated and Canon refuses to honor the warranty.Don\'t ever buy a Canon product as their customer service is HORRIBLE.", negetive
"When I first received it and used it, it worked great.  I put it away for awhile and noticed it needed to be charged.  I will not charge.  Tried everything.  I purchased May 2013, went to use again in July 2013, and that\'s when I noticed it doesn\'t charge.  Maybe I received a lemon but it\'s too bad because the pictures turned out beautiful.  What a waste of good money\!", negetive
"Because the power cord wasn\'t included in the box. After charging, the camera, it didn\'t work. Returned for a full refund.", negetive
"Wanted to have it ready for my wife Christmas morning.  Out of the box the viewed image \(not the menu screens\) was blurred, cleaned the lens etc no help.  Pictures taken came out with incorrect colors and blurred.  Hoping this was a bad one, but with 2 days until Christmas had to go out and buy local.", negetive
"Not sure why it is so hard to buy a point and shoot that takes photos that are in focus. I returned this.  Amazon was great about the return and even paid for the shipping. I bought the Nikon Coolpix S3500. Just a little bit more money and does a much better job.", negetive
"I am not sure why people are not finding this review helpful. If you want to buy it and find out it is cheap quality, that is up to you \!\!\! I am trying to save you the aggravation.I purchased a Canon PowerShot ELPH 110 HS for \$200 which has been flawless.  and I bought this for my Mom, who wanted a simple camera. As soon as we went to install the battery, we realized that the battery cover is not a proper fit, the quality is consistant with a cheaper camera, After two charges of the battery, which involves opening the plastic door, it started to break.  I sent it back.", negetive
"One review remarked that the cord for uploading onto a computer was missing \- figured that was probably a fluke...however...nocord\! No memory card\! A miniscule user manual. We had to download a user manual \- 109 pages on our printer\! We had to goout and buy the transfer cord. And, we have yet to be able to get an old memory card transferred\! This is shoddy stuff and I wassure it had \"Made in China\" somewhere on the packaging...however it says \"Canada\" \- maybe we\'d\'ve been better off had it beenMade in China\!\?\! If it weren\'t such a pain, I would return this in a minute\! This is not worthy of Amazon\'s quality and is the firsttime I have been disappointed by anything I\'ve ever ordered.

"I bought this camera thinking it\'s from Canon so it must be good.  I took it on an international vacation and most of the pictures came out blurry.  It takes a long time for the camera to take a picture and you basically \"lose the moment\" because the camera is so slow.  Its a good camera if you\'ll only take closeups indoor.  I\'m so disappointed that I took such a bad quality camera on my trip and now don\'t have good pictures.  Returned it\!", negetive

You must add them to your order with the camera.  Furthermore, your cart will show them as priced separately and the promotional discount will not appear until you click the \"estimate shipping and tax\" tab... which makes no sense... but that\'s the convoluted way amazon has set this up.Suggestion to Amazon\: If there is to be a promotional item\(s\) applied to a purchase, why not add them to the order AUTOMATICALLY and allow the buyer the option to REMOVE them if desired... rather than requiring the buyer to add those items manually while making it appear as though those items will NOT be free until the moment the order is placed\?

I am now looking for a camera to replace this but am leary since the reviews were good.  Apparently people were paid to say it was good, or Canon put out a big batch of bad cameras\!

After taking a few more pictures I got the same message only this time I was not able to choose \"format\" from the cameras set up menu...I don\'t know why... it just would not allow me to select \"format\" ..  buy a coolpix by nikon.. they are very user friendly .Now I have to return this un usable piece of junk to a target store very far from my home.", negetive
"Purchased this camera Christmas 2013.  By the end of February this camera would no longer accept a charge.I have the warranty but to get it fixed I have to prepay all postage\/shipping\/insurance and delivery costs to the repair facility.If you want a camera that is actually waterproof \/ shockproof, I recommend that you purchase the Nikon S31 instead.", negetive
"Do not buy. The pictures seemed ok quality but mine stopped working after sitting in a desk for 2 months. Never got wet, never dropped, never even used except for a few test pictures of my dog. I believe there are a lot of other reviews stating the same thing. I will write an update after I contact Nikon. Don\'t waste the money\!", negetive
"This is my second underwater camera \(previous being a Lumix one\), and this one barely works. It is plagued by software issues and poor manufacturing. The screen starting showing random white lines after only a few days of use \(not even having been underwater yet\!\) and it just went downhill from there, breaking down completely after a few weeks. We initially thought this would be a good product as we have a DSLR from Nikon, but we ended up very disappointed. Nikon seems to have focused more on adding dozens of useless gadgets as opposed to make a solid, sturdy products that takes good pictures. All this to say, we will stay away from Nikon products from now on.", negetive

"I purchased this camera in November to take underwater pictures while snorkeling.  The memory card and battery were installed prior to leaving our condo, so it was definitely a dry, clean environment.  Took a few pictures from the sailboat and everything was fine.  Took pictures while snorkeling and everything seemed fine until we arrived back at the condo.  Tried to turn the camera on so I could show the others the pictures that were taken and the it would not turn on.  I installed my second battery, and still the cameral would not turn on.  On closer inspection, there appeared to be water behind the viewing screen \(in each of the corners\).  I opened all of the doors and put the entire camera, minus the memory card and battery in a bowl of rice to absorb and moisture, then tried the new battery again.  Still, the camera didn\'t work.  It never worked again.I am very disappointed that my camera didn\'t last even one day.  Fortunately I do have the pictures that were on the memory card, but we missed out on getting more pictures later in the week.", negetive
"The Nikon AW110 takes great outdoor pictures, however, when we tried to take  underwater pics while snorkeling during our trip to the Bahamas in September 2013, we were able to take only 3 pictures before the camera stopped working.  There was no water inside the case and  I even replaced the battery with a spare one but the camera still did not work.  I just sent the AW110 to Nikon in Toronto for repairs which did cost me money to return them the camera.  What is frustrating is that we purchased this camera solely for our trip and unfortunately, we could not use it.  I do not recommend this camera to anyone who would like to use it underwater or near water.", negetive
"Bought this camera last July for some shallow diving. Plans fell through until October. Finally got in the water and was no where near the 59\' and could not get the camera to turn on. When I got back topside noticed water in the view finder. Took it back to the house and pulled the battery and flashes card only to have water come pouring out. Just tried to return it and Amazon said I can no longer return it.", negetive
"If your main reason for purchasing is the underwater feature, SKIP IT\!\! Excellent pictures until one trip to the beach a 30\-40 minutes of on and off underwater scuba pictures and it began to fog up on the back screen and the lens. A few hours later and it was done\! Will no longer even turn on.", negetive
"Bought this camera for a snorkel trip to Akumal Mexico.  Takes great photos above water and I like the fact that you can take panoramic too.  Just don\'t get the camera wet.  The first time under water when I pushed the on button air bubbles came out from the button and the screen was black.  Called Nikon service and they tell me water damage is not covered by the warranty\!  Nikon is the ones that say it\'s waterproof but they don\'t back up their claim\!  I will be getting my money back and buying another brand.  I hear the Panasonic T4 is a good camera.  So long Nikon, I won\'t be purchasing any of your products EVER again\!", negetive
"Another voice warning you about this product.After about an hour of snorkeling I saw a little bit of fog forming between the glass and the screen of the camera.  Another 30 minutes later, the screen wasn\'t able to turn on.  The power button showed it was on, but the screen was black forever more.Nikon really needs to get its act together and recall these given this has been happening to so many people.", negetive
"I purchased this in May and used it 5\-6 times \- mostly in the pool. I took it to the beach and it failed after second swim in the sea. Completely failed \- see pictures on the camera page. I had Pentax Optio W80 underwater camera for about 3.5 years\; took it diving quite a few times and used a lot before it failed this spring. I decided to go with Nikon because you supposed to be able to take it to 59 ft \- but it failed at 5 ft\!Amazon refused to do anything about it because it\'s more than 30 days from the date of purchase. So you can return the product on a whim the first 30 days and not a completely broken product afterwards.Nikon charges for shipping the camera back and then decides if it\'s their fault or mine that the camera fails. Somehow I think that whatever the results \- it\'s my last Nikon purchased.", negetive

"Purchased this camera for a trip to the Tahiti Islands.  The camera lasted only two snorkeling dives and died.The screen went black and has not worked since I am sure this is a problem with this Nikon camera and would strongly recommend you look elsewhere for an underwater camera.  I have several Nikon cameras and love them all but this camera is a lemon for sure.", negetive
"I received this camera as a Bday gift and was very excited and thankful. The camera had been already set up for me with an extra high speed memory stick and so I was ready to start taking some pics. They turned out terrible. Image stabilization was terrible,half of the pics were blurred. The flash did NOT kick in with a low light setting,and when it did finally kick in it over saturated the image. Ive read the other negative reviews on this camera relating to the underwater features being equally as terrible. Im not impressed at all. I am disappointed and discouraged,seems like these point and shoot cameras have all these great features for wifi and HD video and such yet they dont seem to be able to take very good pics,not user friendly,a myriad of menu settings that you have to tediously go through to get the quality you want for a given situation. Im reminded of that Video that \"The Onion\" news network put out a few years ago titled \"Sony\'s new stupid F\%\^\*ing Piece of S\&\$T that doesnt do what its g8d D\&\*ned supposed to\".", negetive
"After looking at the many waterproof \/ rugged camera options, I decided to go with Nikon.  I have multiple Nikon dSLRs and lenses and have been very happy with them.  I now wish that I had paid closer attention to the other negative reviews.In good sunlight, this camera takes decent pictures.  I have only used dSLRs for a few years, and the pictures are not as good, but I didn\'t expect them to be.  I was primarily interested in the rugged and waterproof features.I ordered the camera over a month in advance of a vacation that was to include snorkeling.  With some light use, the back screen of the camera was scratched and scuffed, but I didn\'t worry about that because it did not affect the use or picture quality.The major problem was that within 10 minutes of taking the camera into the ocean, and with the camera not getting more than a foot or two under water \(this was before we even started snorkeling\), the screen died and went completely black.  Even after letting the camera dry out, the screen will not turn on.For the money, this camera is at best a mediocre point\-and\-shoot.  The only real advantage \(in theory\) would be the ruggedness and waterproofing features, but they do not hold up in real world use.  I do not have any other experience with waterproof cameras, but none of the others available could do any worse than this Nikon did for me.", negetive
"Purchased this camera for a trip to Curacao for snorkeling.  Tried it out in the house \- was happy with it.  Turned it on again 2 days before leaving for trip \- black screen.  Had never left the house.  Had never been in water.  Returned to Amazon.  Was able to purchase another at Best Buy the night before my trip.  It lasted 10 days before, again, black screen.  First time \- fine, I got a lemon.  Second time \- inferior product, missed out on photos on my trip, never again\!", negetive
"The camera is not waterproof as stated\! Made a big mistake buying this because I bought this for claims it was\!\'will not buy  Nikon again\!", negetive
"This camera is not waterproof.  Camera died on the first day at the pool in about 3 feet of water.I was able to save the camera by putting it on a dehumidifier, so now it just an expensive point and shoot camera.Really disappointed.  Would have returned it if the return policy hadn\'t elapsed.", negetive
"I am horribly upset I did not listen to other reviews.  I missed so many chances for photos on my recent trip because the display screen stopped working after the first use.  The pictures that it did take turned out great but this is quite expensive for a one time use camera.I was able to contact amazon and they were able to provide a full refund.  Amazon customer service is never a disappointment, unlike this product\!", negetive
"This camera stopped working after a few months of light use. It was sent back to Nikon under warranty overnight \(\$40 shipping by me\). They couldn\'t be bothered to let me know the status of the repair. They did finally send it back by the slowest \(cheapest\) possible UPS. It just showed up , no notice. Not what I\'d expect from Nikon\! Update\-camera came back and failed again, immediately, when it got wet. Now back at Nikon again\!Mark it down to one star and avoid\!", negetive
"I bought this camera specifically for an upcoming vacation with my children to the Cayman Islands. Read the reviews and went with the Nikon because of its features and reported performance. It worked well in the pool, but after about 30 minutes of snorkeling the LCD screen went black and the camera died\! I spent the evening emailing back and forth with Nikon support and the BEST answer they had is that perhaps it was the memory card\?\?\?\? It\'s now day three of seven in the Islands....no camera....Based on my experience I would not recommend you buy this product\!", negetive
"The negative reviews about the Coolpix AW110 screen going blank happened to mine, but fortunately within the warranty\-return period.  The positive reviews are also true, particulary the good picture quality.  So I just wanted to warn others that if you take this underwater, there\'s a high chance its screen will fail.  Even if you follow the rinsing procedures.  I don\'t think camera manufacturers issue recalls, and only firmware updates.", negetive
"I put the camera in the water and the display does not work more. I had to send the camera to Nikon Brazil and now I am without the camera.", negetive
"I\'ve only had the camera for 3 months and it stopped working.  It is completely dead.  The viewfinder appears to have water damage.  This is supposed to be a waterproof camera.  We took it in the water and diving but did not go anywhere near the 59 feet with it.  My children are too young to dive deeper than 35 feet.  I have contacted Amazon for a return and have also contacted Nikon.  Having to go through the repair\/return process is a huge time waster.  But, most importantly, this camera stopped working half\-way through our two week vacation so we were not able to take pictures for an entire week except on our iPhones\!  Completely unacceptable.  This is the first waterproof camera that I have owned that got water damage.  All other brands I bought have held up beautifully \(we have a Go\-Pro as well\).  I would NOT recommend this camera, especially since it was so expensive and will not last.  Don\'t risk your memories\!", negetive
"I am a client of Nikon few years ago and have always been very pleased with the brand and have only cameras of the brand.Currently have a Nikon D7000 with three sets of lenses and I want to buy the D800.Last year I bought a Nikon AW110.After 3 months of use, when I never exceed the depth limits specified, I noticed that it started to show condensation on the lens and LCD screen, which progressively increased to a few drops of water.This has become to obscure and take bad photos .The specification of the camera is for up to 18 meters. I do not dive, I only use the machine in pool and sea to ordinary photos, never surpassed that is 3 meters.I thought it was defective on my unit, which has made \​\​me extremely unhappy .However, when talking to a friend, I discovered that he has the same problem as me.I wish Nikon would take more care with the quality of their products.Although still find their unbeatable DSLR, now I\'m looking for a better camera waterproof for purchase.", negetive

The overall rating of people was 3.5 so I have it a try.Day one in the water ten minutes \( and not even going under the water\) the screen turned black and I could not see the screen.I could retrieve my pictures with the USB cord.

"Q. How do you destroy this waterproof camera\?A. Put it in the water.This camera has several shortcomings, but the most glaring is that the water seals are ineffective.  The lip of the inner seal is literally 1 grain of sand wide \-\- even with very careful use and cleaning, it is not reliable.  After owning it a year, I took it snorkeling in 2 feet of water, and noticed a stream of bubbles coming out of the battery hatch.  Camera destroyed.But there are other problems.  The overall images lack contrast, probably because of the folded optical path.  The auto white balance is confused by many situations.  It is not uncommon to see a great image in the liveview screen while composing a shot \-\- say kids against backlit foliage.  When you snap the picture, the picture that is displayed \(and stored on the card\) is totally washed out.  It then goes back to the beautiful live view.  Sometimes changing the composition slightly would cause the camera to get it right, sometimes or not.  Very frustrating.", negetive
"I cannot tell you how disappointed I am with the Nikon Coolpix AW110 camera\!It was purchased to use exclusively while enjoying water sports.  I recently returned from a trip to the Virgin Islands, where the snorkeling is excellent, crystal clear visibility, glorious variety of undersea life....Imagine my disappointment when this crummy camera stopped working the minute it went in the ocean\!  The screen went black and the on\/off button stopped functioning.\(Ironically, the camera slowly came back to life after I left 2 mini silica packs into the battery slot for over a week after I had returned home.\)I won\'t ever immerse this camera in water again, as it is obviously defective and NOT waterproof.I didn\'t need another \'dry\' camera as I already have several. \:\(Nikon customer service wants me to ship \& insure it \( at my cost\) for an evaluation\/ estimate for repair costs.

Sometimes it will record the video.What a waste of a camera\!For what pictures and videos I did take, they were good, but what good is the camera if it keeps fogging up on you.", negetive
"What is the minimum basic requirement that you should expect from a consumer electronic product in this day and age\? That it should turn on and work.Like many of you, I bought this Nikon for a watersports\-filled vacation, opened the box, charged the battery overnight, put the camera and the manual in my carry\-on bag so I had something to do on the long flight. While in\-flight I pulled out the camera expecting to learn all its features.I then pressed the ON button. Here\'s what happened\: after several seconds of a blank screen,  a flash of white screen appeared together with a single exclamation point, then immediately blank screen again. Huh\? I tried it again and again with the same result. I tried it with and without different memory cards. I tried it after pulling the battery out and back in, and making sure the battery orientation was correct. I studied the manual but found no special startup instructions or description of the exclamation point screen in the troubleshooting section.At the hotel I recharged the battery to make sure that wasn\'t the problem, but the next day the camera behaved similarly.To explain my prior camera history and experience, previously I\'ve owned waterproof cameras by Olympus and Fuji but since gave them away to relatives. I also shoot with the Fuji X\-100s, a Canon DSLR, and several Lumix micro four thirds cameras and lenses. For this waterproof camera, I should have chosen the Lumix or Olympus or even GoPro waterproof cameras, but I thought that this would be a good opportunity to try a Nikon interface.In this day and age a consumer electronic product from a major brand that flashes an error screen right out of the box\? Disappointing poor quality. I\'m never buying Nikon again.", negetive
"I have owned mainy waterproof Point and Shoots over the years.  This was the absolute worse.\(please note, the camera was only opened \& then closed immediately to charge the battery or remove memory card.  As well, the seal was always checked for debris before closing\)Dry\- Travel to Nepal \& between the lense elements it would fog up if used often or in video mode.  So many photos wasted as blurred due to moisture.After trip, the camera was then sent in for warranty, and a new camera delivered.Wet \-  used it on surface of water fine, when splashed.  Snorkling on the surface, and no more than 10ft deep, the camera died within in 5 mins and never recovered.Never again a Nikon\…..", negetive
"its probably been 3 months i gave this camera as a gift... it doesn\'t work the individual used it all of three times... It seems as though water got on the inside and there is corrosion\!

Considering the amount I paid for the camera i didn\'t expect lifetime usage but definitely more than 3 months\!", negetive
"Short of it\: Failed in shallow water like so many other peoples AW110.We purchased this camera a few weeks before a trip to St John Virgin Islands that involved a lot of snorkeling. The camera controls and features are great. The pictures were good quality for a little point and shoot. The pictures before the trip in a pool came out wonderful. The only issue that we had with it was that 3 days into our trip it died. The screen went black which made the camera little more than useless. Many other people complain of the same issue with it so it seems to be a fairly common fault with this model. The deepest we went with it was probably 5 or 6 feet, most of the time was surface snorkeling. If you want a camera that can get splashed while you are boating this is probably a good idea. If you want something that can go into a couple feet of water stay away from this camera. It seems unimaginable that it could actually go to the 18 meters and still function when so many of them break a couple feet from the surface. In short we want to love this camera, we tried to love this camera, the features are great, except the one feature that we bought it for, to use in water. Nikon if you actually had this camera waterproofed it would be a killer, instead it scares me away from your brand. Feel free to keep my camera that I used for 3 days and just sent in for warranty until you solve this problem since it\'s pretty useless to me as it is now.Update\: We received an estimate from Nikon of \$148.84 to repair this camera. The paperwork said that it was not covered by warranty. When I call to get more information as to why they denied the warranty I just get a message that says all their staff is assisting other calls then their phone system hangs up. Not only would I rate this camera low but Nikon\'s support is non\-existent for all intents and purposes.", negetive
"Like many others I bought this camera for a holiday including snorkelling.  Like many others, the screen of my camera stopped working after a couple of days.  I would prefer to award no stars \(at least one is required\), this camera takes beautiful pictures when it works, but this hardly vindicates the appalling reliability that is obvious from the reviews on this and other sites.  No one wants to spend over \£200 for a couple of days photography.You really need to sort yourselves out Nikon, read the reviews and weep for the prestige that your company once had.", negetive

I have been meticulous with SD card and battery insertion, and checking the seal and debris.Yesterday, while casually paddleboarding, it finally succumbed to whatever design flaw that causes it to leak.Now it is dead and will never turn back on. Very disappointing for a camera with a rated 59 foot depth\!  I never took it more than 4 feet underwater.I wanted a camera i could keep in my boardshorts to avoid theft on the beach, this one couldn\'t handle that basic task.", negetive
"We purchased this camera for our trip to St. John.  What a mistake\!  Display died after our first day of snorkeling and water may have gotten under screen.  Camera should be waterproof to dive up to 59 feet\!  Amazon should pull this camera from their web site.  It is a piece of junk and huge disappointment when you pay good money to purchase something to capture your vacation memories and end up having to buy expensive, crappy, disposable cameras.  I would rate it no stars, if possible.", negetive

"Quite simply the worst camera I have ever owned.  I should qualify that to say the worst digital camera.  I moved to the coolpix after having \"leakage\" problems with the Olympus stylus tough.

"I bought this camera because I was going to be doing a lot of swimming and active sports in Croatia and I wanted to capture the unique experiences.  The camera took really good photos the first couple of days, but as soon as I got in the water...and I mean only for a swim, no diving... the screen went black. This was day three of a 12 day trip.  I was unable to use the camera for the remainder of my trip.  Once I got home, I turned on the camera just to see what would happen...and sure enough, the screen was working again.  Perfect timing.  For a camera that advertises as a deep water use camera, it is definitely a lie\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!  If you are looking for a camera to use in the water, I would pass this one up. You will regret it.  Lucky enough, Amazon is so great that they let me return the camera without an issue.", negetive
"Got this camera this morning, obviously super excited to open it up and start using it. As I took it out of the box, I\'ve noticed brown rust marks on the inside of the lens cover\; the marks were mostly in the corners and then two spots towards the middle. Once switched on you can actually see two blurred spots as you move the camera around and of course they are visible in every single photo taken. It looks like the camera was water tested, got some water in \(went unnoticed\) and eventually the leaked rusty water gathered on the inside of the lens cover. How does leakage\/water damage like this make it past quality control\?\!If this camera already shows signs of water damage the moment you take it out of the packaging then I can only smell disaster.This camera is going straight back to Amazon for a refund.", negetive
"I purchased this camera because I heard it had the best image quality of the \"tough\" point and shoots. When you\'re standing completely still, shooting a stationary target in ideal lighting conditions, it produces decent photos.However, when it comes to real world use, most of your shots come out completely unusable. Blurred subjects, and horrible under\/over exposure. I\'m being completely serious when I say that iPhone cameras outperform the aw110 in real world use. My 8 year old midrange Canon powershot A540 outperforms the brand new aw110 in every way.  Very disappointing.I\'m sending it back for a refund asap. I\'d suggest looking elsewhere for a tough camera.", negetive
"After reading the reviews for both the AW100 and AW110 and reading up reviews and comparison articles on the Internet, I thought this would be the best bet and most reliable.  So I bought this camera and 2 days later took it to Hawaii thinking that I\'ll be set to take all the underwater photos I want.  I read the user manual and made sure there were no obstructions on the side compartment where the battery and memory card is located before heading out to go snorkeling.  Probably no more than 5\-10mins in the water and the screen goes blank.  I can\'t seem to turn it back on.  I\'ve let it dried out since then and sure enough the camera won\'t turn back on.  Dead in the water...quite literally.  I\'ve put in a return request, so let\'s see if Amazon will reimburse me for this junk.  I will be shipping this back in the next few days.  Amazon\'s already informed me they\'re going to charge me a return fee.  I recommend not buy this to begin with, and if you\'re going to take the risk, buy it from Fry\'s instead. It\'s exactly the same price at Fry\'s, and if you return it, you\'ll at least be fully reimbursed and not have to pay a return fee.", negetive

"I bought this camera and used it 3 times over a 2 week period.  I bought this to use while kayaking in the ocean.  I\'m an avid DSLR user and a Nikon fan for many years.  The camera was only used in the surf zone and was never submerged further than a foot and for less than a minute.  The lens immediately fogged up.  I think it was condensation as the water was very cold and the air was very warm \(January in So Cal has been very warm\).  Never\-less, the camera was not usable until it warmed up and the fog cleared.  I returned and am trying a different brand of camera.", negetive
"Seriously, if you\'re considering this for any underwater photography... STEER CLEAR\!\!\!  As others have posted, this camera isn\'t waterproof.  Used snorkeling and it died on the third time used.  Followed all instructions to the letter, yet the lens fogged up and camera wouldn\'t turn on again.  Would give a Battery overheated message and shut down.  So, 3 days into a 16 day vacation, our camera was rendered useless.  Thankfully we had our phones for land shots, but missed a ton of great opportunities underwater.SAVE YOUR MONEY and look for something else.", negetive
"I had this camera out of the box for a day and now it\'s right back in it and getting sent back. I started out wondering what I had gotten when the buttons on the camera were \"sloppy.\" I ignored that and continued to take pictures and videos to get a feel for the camera and it\'s different features. Zooming was impossible. The lens simply would not focus. I kept getting a screen message saying, \"initializing lens. Cannot focus.\" Well...no kidding\! On the video\'s anything I zoomed into turned out blurry. With stills the lens either did not focus at all and the pictures were blurred or if it did manage to have a clear moment, the pictures turned out very grainy. Overall I was not impressed with the quality of pictures this took at all.I bought this because it was waterproof and could be used to take underwater pictures. Little is said in the manual about how to do that, however.  There are some \"don\'ts,\" but no tips or hints or instructions that might help someone doing underwater shots for the first time. This camera was a huge disappointment. I had read reviews and researched other cameras with similar features and decided on this one. My mistake.", negetive
"Here is the straight scoop. I read a ton of reviews of this camera, the Canon, Pentax, Olympus waterproof cameras. The problem is the reviews dont really use the camera underwater. We went to Bora Bora \(trip of a lifetime\) with our 4 and 7 year old and the camera worked great on the beach \- but as soon as we went in the water it leaked water. My kids are young \- we were snorkeling \- so about 6\-12 inches from the surface. I also bought Nikons floaty leash \(worked great\) so the camera was never more that 12 \- 18 inches deep and it leaked. When it dried out it came back to life and does work \- but anytime it is\- immersed it leaks. Ive had a few Nikon cameras over the years and not had any problems. So I returned it to Nikon when we got back. I have just logged on to the Nikon service center to see the status \- and heres what I see \:Problem\: LIQUID DAMAGE CLEAN \& CHECKTotal cost of repair\: \$137.50\*So \- as much as I like the form factor of the camera and the photos are decent \(when not waterlogged\), Im not going to be taking Nikon\'s repair center up on their offer. Im in the market for a really waterproof waterproof camera. With two kids under ten \- I dont need much \- just a few feet of water \- swimming pools and ocean.So Im afraid the other reviews you see on Amazon about this camera not being waterproof are true and while DP camera and others do great reviews \- the reviews here are from people who actually have used the camera underwater.I run a company. Im not sure how Nikon feels about selling a product that claims to be waterproof and then attempts to charge you for \'fixing it\' when it leaked in 1 foot of water.", negetive
"I have owned this camera for two months, and now I also have a broken camera. Unlike some of the other reviews, my camera has taken fine underwater pictures on several dive trips \(going 30 feet or more deep\), while playing in the pool, snorkeling in the ocean, etc.  As far as a general point and shoot camera, I have not been impressed \(both my Canon and Panasonic were far better, more intuitive and more customizable when it came to manual modes\).  But, we held onto it because we were getting some great \"in the water\" shots. Unfortunately, on our last trip, the display screen went black and has never returned. The camera seems to turn on \- even seems to take pictures, but since there is no view finder and the display does not work...All in all, I wish I had read the reviews on Amazon before purchasing. Too bad. Sorry Nikon \- you have lost a customer.", negetive
"Agonised over buying this for days after reading the mixed reviews \- am travelling in Thailand and was in Bangkok heading south so wanted an underwater\/rugged camera \- was sucked in by the 18m waterproof and thought \'surely it can\'t be that bad and if I really take care of it I won\'t have the problems others mention\'...2 weeks of owning it and treating it like a new born the following have been observed1\) Someone described the screen as a scratch magnet \- could not put it better myself \- lady in the shop put a \'free\' screen protector on \- horrified when made it back to hotel and took it out and immediately noticed TWO scratches that look to have gone through the protector\! I bought a case especially after purchasing and put it straight in there \- How the \*\*\*\* did that happen\?\!\! Right now the screen is scuffed pretty much all over and I don\'t know how it is happening so easily\! I treat my iPhone \(using now to write this\) far worse and the screen still looks good as new \- I\'ve also just noticed the writing on the front is all rubbing off\! Sure I don\'t really care about the looks but surely this should not be happening on a \'rugged\' camera\?2\) I like to mess around with white balance \- not impressed with the AWB and equally not impressed with the manual set white balance \(which is kinda laborious to go and set each time too\) much prefer my old canon IXUS3\) I also like to mess about with long shutter times and kicked myself for forgetting to check if this camera can do it \- it can\'t as far as I can work out... \:\( the longest is 4 seconds using the \'fireworks\' scene mode... \(Which means you also cannot use manual white balance in a scene mode...\)4\) Pictures \- they\'re OK and I am most definitely no pro photographer but my old Canon IXUS that this has replaced seems to take far superior looking photo\'s5\) The action button \(the button you use to take the photo\!\) is hard to press and try to keep the camera still at the same time in my opinion6\) The BIGGEST one and the reason that has prompted me to add this review is that the lens has just misted up\!\!\! It\'s hardly been in the water\! I tested it on day one in a sink full of water \(break it in gently...\) and no apparent problems \- meticulously dried it and noticed there are holes around the lens area that were holding water in there so really let it dry out properly \- since then it\'s been in the shallows in the sea twice \(literally just took it in with me when paddling about in the surf at the shore\) \- taken back to hotel room and dried meticulously each time before opening battery cover... I am on the beach now and was just taking some shots then about to head in for a swim\/snorkel and noticed the lens misted up...I am majorly \*\*\*\*\*\* at myself and feel like kicking my own butt from here back to Bangkok to return it but I bought it knowing full well \'no returns\' and that the warranty \(Thailand only...\) only covers \'faults\' not water related damage...\!How Nikon can sell this I don\'t know... Perhaps they will admit a design\/build fault and some kind of recall\?I will have a stab at trying to get my money back one way or another and attempt to contact Nikon directly \(this is NOT a cheap camera\!\) but I think I have about as little chance of that happening as this camera surviving any more water related activities...Why people are giving it 5 stars and saying they have not even tried it in the water is beyond me \- surely there are a billion and one cameras on the market that take just as good photos for a quarter of the price that work \'out of the water\' \- the uniqueness of the AW 110 is that it is supposed to be ruggedised no...\? I mean that is what you\'re paying the money for right...\?Really really really wish I had never bought it and that is so disappointing \:\(", negetive
"I am currently on my second AW110.  I purchased the AW110 2 days prior to going on vacation to Bermuda.  I was expecting to take great photos while snorkeling with this camera.  The camera is rated for underwater use at a depth of 59\', and not to exceed 1 hour.  I snorkeled for 30 minutes, and did not reach a depth greater than 10\' \(which is a generous over\-estimate\).  Upon coming out of the water, the camera would turn on, but the screen would not illuminate.  The screen remained black and is no longer functional.  While the camera has many nice features like integrated Wi\-Fi, GPS, and the ability to take 3D pictures, the camera just didn\'t hold up to even 1\/6th of the promised depth.  I contacted Nikon Customer Support\/Service which was a complete and utter joke.  The representative that I spoke with claimed to be both customer service and technical support\; she was neither technically proficient nor friendly.  I was told to send my camera into Nikon at my own expense for it to be evaluated and Nikon would repair it if possible.  If the camera was not repairable, they would \"possibly\" replace it.  I am extremely thankful that I purchased the AW110 from Amazon.com as they just replaced the entire Camera with minimal questions asked, prepaid return shipping, and the postal carrier picked up the package at my front door.  Lastly, I read many reviews before purchasing this camera and this has happened to MANY MANY individuals.  A basic search on the Internet as well as Amazon.com will show an overwhelming community of consumers that have been viciously bitten by this product.  When I mentioned this to the Technical Support Representative, she exclaimed that she had never heard of this issue before... I\'ll leave the readers of this review to generate their own opinion on that note.  If I didn\'t already have a Nikon DSLR prior to purchasing this AW110, I\'d be sure to shop with the 5 \- Letter competitor that starts with C and ends with anon.  Furthermore, I urge any representative of Nikon with any level of pride in their organization that may be reading this review to contact me.Update \#1\: Nikon rejected this very same review on their website for \"One or more reasons\" which are unnamed.  Only positive reviews are allowed. \;\)", negetive

"Steer clear of this camera. If you are wise you will stay away from this brand of camera also ... their repair service is INCOMPETENT. I purchased this camera on April 19th, 2013. It received light usage for the next couple of months. I always noticed how flaky the screen, focus and white balance were acting from the first turn on of the device ... but it took reasonable pictures, so I ok with it. I then took the camera on vacation, and it started to freeze up on every other picture taken. I would have to remove the battery and reinsert to reboot the camera.I sent the camera in Nikon service. It comes back, \"adjusted and cleaned\" which is code for \(I have worked in the electronics business\) we did nothing, cause we could find nothing wrong. The device, based on shipping time, was in the service center ONE DAY .. so no one bothered to stress test it.So two weeks ago, same issue. I am taking a couple pictures, and the camera freezes up .. I have to remove the battery to reboot. I send it in again. This time I explained in detail, that I thought based on the problems occurring that the zoom motor may be shorting, which can cause EMF noise and logic circuits to go haywire. After one day the camera comes back again .. We cannot duplicate your problem. its costs me \$10 to ship this camera to their service center each time ... Why would I want to do it multiple times\? You would think on the second visit, they might expose the camera to more rigorous tests, or replace the camera ... But no ... back it comes with no work whatsoever ...This is my last Nikon product. I hope this review alerts perspective customers. I have a Panasonic camera that is very similar, and it is ROCK SOLID ... Do yourself a favor ... look to another brand of camera\!\!\!", negetive
"Have owned nikon cameras since 1984 and have been impressed with their quality and feel as well as picture quality. My oldest nikon still works perfectly. I have a nikon dslr and nikkor lens and again no problems.  Then I bought the \"waterproof\" nikon.  It did well until we went to the Bahamas. Second day of an eight day vacation we went snorkling. Max depth was maybe 10 feet.  Came out of the water and it would not turn on.  Opened battery compartment , wheel was in lock position, inside was water, ruined.  Previous year was used in pool, beach, etc with no problems.  I think that it was just not made well enough for serious water use.  Will not buy again. Still like the nikon brand and if they come out with a new one I will probably buy it, but not this model.", negetive

"I bought this camera to take on my honeymoon in a few weeks. Having received it and started fooling around with it I will absolutely not keep it after the vacation.At first glance this is a well built camera and I\'m excited to do underwater photography. It has a good depth rating for the money. I\'ll simply break down what I find to be the pluses and minuses.PROS\:Well builtGood button layoutImage quality is good. Don\'t have much to compare it to but I like what I\'ve shot so far.It is more than just waterproof. It is also drop proof to 6.6ft. This would be a good camera to take hiking too.CONS\:You must remove the battery and charge it externally. Not that big of a deal but when you do this you lose all of your settings. You must set up the camera all over again every time you charge it. Ridiculous.Wireless access is off and greyed\-out in the menu. I have no way to activate it apparently. The menu does not mention it whatsoever.This is my second Nikon camera, the other being a mid\-range DSLR I bought 4 years ago. It will be my last. Both cameras had strong points but ultimately had such irritating drawbacks that they weren\'t worth owning. It certainly isn\'t a piece of garbage, but unless you need to shoot underwater I would avoid this camera.UPDATE\: I ended up returning this camera immediately after returning from the honeymoon that I bought it for. The camera locked up CONSTANTLY which necessitated pulling the battery out. To do so you must break the seal so while it was somewhat possible when we were walking waist deep in the water off the beach \(still not a good idea though\), it was completely impossible while snorkeling obviously. It nearly ruined my ability to record my honeymoon, and I lost a lot of good images and videos because it would be locked up while snorkeling and I wouldn\'t know it \(it is nearly impossible to make out the screen while underwater so you basically just point and click and pray it is recording\).", negetive

This camera is too expensive to be worthless after 1 use in 3 feet of water\! VERY DISAPPOINTED IN WASTING MONEY \& MISSING OUT ON ONCE IN A LIFETIME OCCASION PHOTO OPPORTUNITIES\!\!\!

"I bought this camera to use on my wedding\/honeymoon in Turks and Caicos. As previously stated by other reviews it does work great\-when it wants to work. After about 5 days of using this in and out of the water the screen wouldn\'t turn on\!

"I have a Nikon D200 dSLR and take thousands of photos.  I wanted to have something more compact for less technical photos and videos and purchased the AW110 with an eye towards using it at zoos, aquariums, parks and on outings where a dSLR is too bulky or intrusive.  While the AW110 is smaller than I\'d expected, it\'s not at all user friendly.  Even attempting to simply use the pre\-programmed settings for macro close\-ups, \"sports\" action, pets and similar functions failed to achieve the desired results.  More distressing, I would play with settings to get the image to look right on the screen then take a photo and find that the photo looked nothing like what the screen showed.  I would try to compensate to get the look I had seen on the screen and spent 15\-20 minutes on a photo that I took \& got the right look with one exposure from my iPhone.  Now granted it\'s an iPhone 5, but I really had expected the AW110 to be more effective and useful than an iPhone.  Apparently, this is not the case.  I got so frustrated with this little camera, I was tempted to throw it in the trash.  I went back to the car and got my dSLR and took photos that looked right after a single shot when the AW110 took 5\-6 shots to achieve correct exposure.  In addition, the lens constantly fails to focus, then the camera software resets itself wasting time that could be spent shooting.  This was the biggest mistake I have ever made in purchasing photography equipment.", negetive
"I would NOT recommend this camera to anyone.  The photo quality, even above water, is not that great \(my 5 year old Canon P\&S still does a better job\) and beyond that the camera stopped working in under 30 days.  We purchased this to go snorkeling on vacation.  Before we even got to the snorkeling location, the battery had died \(maybe 20 photos in\), and with a fresh battery, the camera wouldn\'t turn on.  I noticed the next day there was condensation behind the screen, and water in the lens area.  The camera had been dunked in water here and there, splashed and whatnot, but not immersed for a long period of time, or anything deeper than 3 feet.I contacted Nikon customer care who told me that the camera wasn\'t powering on because I used an \"unapproved\" SD card \(Samsung\).  There was NO NOTICE ANYWHERE in the box about using only approved SD cards \- nothing in the quick start guide.  It\'s allegedly in the manual \(included on CD\), but I have NO idea why they wouldn\'t put a warning in the box or on the camera if it\'s that important.  Beyond that, there\'s water in the camera\!  Might that be the reason why the camera failed\?  I\'m INCREDIBLY disappointed with support.If, for any reason you\'re thinking about buying this camera, don\'t.  Get a regular P\&S and a good waterproof bag like an aquapac.", negetive
"Wish I had read the warnings others had about this product failing in water. Having used several underwater cameras for years \(but never a Nikon\) with excellent luck, I figured the technology was pretty well refined at this point. I could not have been more wrong. This camera failed after only a few hours of snorkeling on our recent trip to Hawaii, forcing us to purchase a new camera \(a FinePix XP65 which was much cheaper, not rated anywhere near this camera\'s depth, and which after many more days of snorkeling still works\!\) The failure also prevented us from taking photos during the most beautiful of our snorkeling events \(Kapoho Tide Pools\). Like many, my screen failed first, and the entire camera failed shortly thereafter. So believe the reviews, there is something wrong with this model\; either a design flaw in the model line or severe quality control issues are causing the waterproofing to fail even when the camera is taken no where near the rated depth. Since this product completely fails to function in one of the key areas it is designed to function, it gets a 1 star rating.", negetive
"While the specifications and photographic performance of this camera are amazing, the well\-reported battery issue still exists, at least on my copy.After researching this camera extensively, I decided to give it a try as most reports of a battery indicator issue were dated from summer to fall of 2013.  A couple of recent reviews indicated that the problem may no longer exist.  I purchased the camera on 2\/16\/2014 and fully charged the battery before using.  For the first hour or so, I had no issues \- frequently cycling between various photo modes and video.  However, then the issues began.  Just like other reviewers have described, the issue is not so much battery life, but the discrepancy of the battery life indication between photo mode and video mode.  The charge indicator can show nearly a full charge in photo mode but when you start recording a video it will drop to below half and turn red.  The camera did turn off on a couple of occasions due to low battery, but when powered up again, the battery indicator showed a healthy charge.Based on about one day of testing I concluded the camera simply could not be trusted and returned it.  This would have been my fourth Canon camera, after enjoyable experiences with an S400, an SD900, and a Rebel T1i.", negetive

"SX280 has a known problem with battery indicator on this camera, when switching over to video the indicator flashes and then the camera shuts off, I\'m only getting 10 seconds of video on a full charge.  Canon says it\'s fixed but it\'s not, it still does it with the firmware update.  If you do buy one and it has this problem, return it immediately, don\'t wait until the return period is up, I got stuck with it because I didn\'t test the video until after the return period was over and now I have a sucky camera that cannot be repaired, I believe they have forgotten about all of these and washed their hands of the problem by telling everyone it\'s fixed, check the Canon Forums, nobody has had theirs repaired, thanks Canon I\'ll shop elsewhere.", negetive

Nothing worse than whipping out the camera to capture something with a full battery and have the camera tell me the battery is dead. Even better is getting 3 photos into a shoot with a full battery and having it shut off on me.Of course the battery isn\'t really dead but it\'s a huge hastle never knowing if your camera is going to work when you need it to.

"We bought this camera and went on a weekend fall trip and were unable to do any videos\!\!\!  when we started to record a video the battery would flash empty and when we would try to zoom,  the camera automatically shut down.  very disappointing.  so I called cannon to ask about the problem. they told me that all we had to do was go on there website and download some firmware and this would remedy the software glitch.  I asked why these cameras were still being sold with this problem and not being recalled.  no explanation.  so we went to the cannon website and to update the software we have to purchase a SIm card reader cord for 14 dollars.  The cannon representative some how failed to mention this part of the process to us.  If you want days of frustration and spend more money to update your camera by this one.  I am disappointed in amazon and cannon for continuing to send customers this camera.  Both companies know if it has a particular serial number that those cameras have this problem.  We are amazon prime members and will think about this the next time we go to buy something.", negetive

"I have been using Canon cameras since around 2001 \(this is probably the 10th Camera I have owned in the PowerShot series over that time\-frame\).We purchased this camera specifically for a trip to South Africa since we planned on taking several photos of animals in the wild at far distances, but didn\'t want to bring along something the size of a DSLR. First of all, I must say that the photos that this camera takes are nothing short of spectacular.  The focus is crystal clear for most shots and the zoom is amazing for something that fits in a pocket.  In my opinion, this camera took photos nearly as good as some of the DSLR cameras that other people in our tour group had.  In fact, the owners of those DSLR cameras were shocked by the quality of this camera as well and have asked me to send them some photos of animals that came out blurry on their cameras but came out perfectly on this camera.The optics of this camera are very impressive given the wide range of zoom.  Chromatic aberration is noticeable but not terrible on some images at full zoom.One minor issue is that the flash pops up and is in a very annoying area for most people \(where most people place their left hand on the camera\).  I personally got used to holding the camera differently to get around the annoyance, but it is still a problem for when we ask someone else to take our photo.Now for the reason I gave this camera one star.This camera suffers from the same issue posted by numerous other reviewers where the camera immediately shuts down due to low battery while attempting to record video and using the zoom feature simultaneously.  This happens even on a full charge \(tested with several different batteries including the original\).  This is a well documented issue \(do a web search for \"canon sx280 battery problems\" and you will see.\).  Removing the battery and reinserting it causes the battery meter to show a full charge again and the camera functions just fine until attempting to take video again where the problem repeats itself.Canon claims to have fixed the issue with a firmware patch. I performed the firmware update advised by Canon and verified that the new firmware was correctly installed however as other reviewers can confirm this still did not solve the problem. Note that the firmware update only requires a blank 32MB SD card, not an expensive 32GB SD card that other users have reported \(big difference between price of an 32 MB card vs 32 GB\).I have a theory that this problem is a design flaw at the hardware level that can not be fixed with software \(firmware\).  It appears to be a hardware problem not correctable by any firmware updates caused by the battery voltage during times of high power draw \(encoding the video plus zooming\).  Canon is very aware of the issue and so far has not recalled the camera.  I am not sure why they are trying to sweep this issue under the rug at the expense of their reputation.Some people are reporting that the firmware update fixed the problems.  Maybe that is true for cameras made after a specific date. According to the canon firmware update instructions, this problem affects cameras where the 6th digit of the serial number is lower than 3.  The 6th digit on mine was a 2.So if you have one of these where the 6th digit is a 2 or lower and experience the same problem, then please return it to Canon and don\'t just \"live\" with the problem as I almost did.I ultimately returned the camera and will keep purchasing the same camera and returning it until I am one of the \"lucky ones\" with a 6th digit of a serial number greater than 2 so that I can have a fully working camera with video.", negetive
"I was so looking forward to purchasing this camera as I have owned several Canons and this looked to be the best point\-and\-shoot so far. It had so many good reviews, I was so disappointed to apparently get a lemon.The first day I used it \(on a fully charged battery\), the battery indicator light started flashing when I used the video. I looked up the problem and found this complaint on one of the Canon forums.  It sounded like a glitch that could be ignored.  But after about a week, not only did the battery indicator flash, the camera would shut down while using video.  It then started shutting down every time I used the zoom to take a photo. I took out the battery, recharged, but the problem only got worse.  It became so I could not even take a photo, and then the camera wouldn\'t even turn on.It\'s been such a frustrating experience and it\'s upsetting to since learn that many other people have had this same problem. I\'ve been a loyal Canon customer, but after this, I\'m reluctant to buy another one of their cameras.", negetive
"Update March 11\:I mailed my camera to have the firmware updated by Canon. This is as per the technical support. Upon receiving my camera, Canon offered to send to me a refurbished model with all the updates. You can imagine my reaction \- as any one else\'s would be.  What\!\!\! Clearly it is a Scam.  I demanded my original brand new one.  I am waiting for Canon to sort out things.BEWARE and don\'t take the route I did.February 23\:It is not my first camera but this one is a winner. I love this camera for all the pros that other reviewers noted. I am a mom of 2 under 10 kids and having a camera for me to capture the precious moments in our lives is a MUST. Rating of 4 stars \(and not 5\) is for the problem that camera is known to cause and the time you need to spend to correct it.My first camera had a problem with battery indicator. As per Cannon technical support, only some cameras have the battery indicator\/shutting down problem. Those that are affected are with the serial number listed on the bottom of the camera where the 6th digit from the left is 1 or 2. Well, I requested an exchange from the seller and a brand new camera was sent to me.  I was hoping I would receive a \"problem free\" replacement. However, the second camera has exactly the same problem and the digit is 3.I called Cannon directly since I did not want to deal with self repair \- 1800 652 2666. Cannon is willing to repair its xs280 models for free. Don\'t forget to ask for a free shipping label which can be emailed to you. Cannon claims that turnaround time for a repair is 4\-5 business days with paid 2 day fedex return.I placed my repair order with Cannon today and am waiting for email with a shipping label to be send.I am really set on keeping this camera so I will go trough the trouble. I bought the camera to capture my kids\' precious moments. The camera works great in the low light settings during kids indoor school performances. My daughter is a swimmer and a gymnast \- with the camera and this amazing zoom, for the first time in 8 years I am able to get close up shots of her in action during performances and swim races.", negetive
"Sadly we didn\'t purchase our camera on Amazon so we don\'t have the benefit of their return policy\! The previously mentioned problems with shooting video make this otherwise fine camera a huge disappointment. Considering all the shinning reviews this camera gets we have to wonder if Canon isn\'t paying people to write this pablum, unfortunately for us we read only those reviews. There are literally tens of thousands of complaints made to Canon and it\'s been posted in every camera forum on the internet.If you are interested in purchasing this camera please consider the following. Shortly after purchase our camera began having the well documented video problems, we were unable to video more than about one minute before camera shutdown \(we had the GPS shut off\).  After contacting customer support we were instructed to do the firmware update. The support staff commented that this was the first they heard of this problem, apparently they have repeated that lie thousands of times, this too is posted all over the internet. The firmware update did not affect the length of video recording at all, no improvement. The last contact with Canon went unanswered, this too is apparently happening all over.Canon dropped the ball on this and now has abandoned the customer, we won\'t purchase another Canon product.", negetive

"I have always used Cannon cameras and I cannot say enough good things about the company. So I bought this recently because of wifi and ability to upload to social media. The camera takes great pictures, the iPhone app works fine, although it uploads only one image at a time. But the browser was the biggest disaster. I installed it on my Mac. The launcher typically has an icon for a software. Cannon has many little apps within one folder I have to find the right icon that would open the browser. The first time I open, it quits. This happens every time I open it. I connect the camera, but do not see an image of my picture. I try to import it, but I cannot. This browser will not import any other picture already on my hard drive either. Needless to say, I have failed to use this camera for uploading photos anywhere. So don\'t buy it if you intend to use the browser. Just so everyone knows, I was reading the pdf manual before installing the browser. I wish Amazon would just take this product back so I can buy something other than cannon. On the Cannon web site the browser has one star from 11 reviewers. So I am not the only one with these views.There is a firmware issue that shows battery low in video mode. I was able to download and address this issue quickly. Not trying to ding Cannon, but the poor quality of browser is just shocking. I cannot believe that the brand I have so respected could let me down so completely.IGNORE WHAT I SAID ABOUT THE FIRMWARE. I TURNED ON THE MOVIE MODE AND THE LOW BATTRY LIGHT JUST CAME ON. WOW\! I ALSO NOTICED THAT ANOTHER REVIEW HAD THE SAME PROBLEM AFTER UPDATING THE FIRMWARE. RETURNING THE CAMERA. JUST PRINTED THE RETURN SHIPPING LABEL.", negetive
"I\'ve had the SX260 for the last year, but it\'s lens is scratched, so I bought the SX280.  But sadly, I played with if for a few hours and it is clear that the battery issue while taking videos is a fatal flaw with the SX280.  Returning it today.", negetive
"I recently order the Canon Powershot SX280 from Amazon with the intent of using it myself and then if I liked it to give one to my daughter as well.  It was in response to my daughter asking for advice on her next camera. I already owned a Canon SX260 and was completely pleased with it, but wanted WiFi to be able to connect to my iPad and phone.  When it came I charged it up and began to take pictures.  All was well, but when I called my daughter about it, she immediately went on Amazon and read all of the reviews that had a one or two star rating.  She called me back and said that she was concerned that so many of the reviews discussed a flaw in the battery monitoring system that caused the camera to shut down if it was used for video.  I don\'t use video, so I had never tested that mode.  When I switched to video, the SX280 began blinking the battery indicator in red.  If I kept taking video or even switched to still mode the camera would turn off after a few seconds.  It could be reset by powering on again, but if you again went to video mode it would repeat the cycle.I then did a search on Google and found that this problem began being reported almost as soon as Canon put it on the market.  A couple of months later they announced a new firmware load that was supposed to fix it.  Apparently it did not.  I read hundreds of customer complaints that their cameras just could not work if you used the video mode.  I contacted Canon and asked them if they had a fix.  Their reply was that I would have to send them the camera to evaluate the problem.  Most of the customer complaints had said that when they sent their camera to Canon it would be returned with the exact same problem.  I argued with Canon that they must have known about the defect considering the number of complaints, but they just ignored me and said that there was nothing they could do unless I sent them the camera.Clearly the camera is defective.  My guess is that it is a hardware issue and they cannot fix it with firmware upgrades.  Why they would leave it on the market without fixing the camera circuitry is beyond me, but I suspect it is because if they admitted it was a hardware problem, or if they withdrew it from the market before the next model came out they might be subject to a recall situation.I returned the camera to Amazon since it was only 6 days old.", negetive
"This camera is defective and there has been no fix for the battery problem related to taking videos.  Some people say that they only use the camera for still photos but that is like saying \"I don\'t need the traction control on my car to work because I don\'t drive in the snow much\". It is defective and Canon knows about it.  Even more despicable is the fact that they do not acknowledge the severity of the problem and that reviewing organizations are not doing their job alerting prospective buyers.  I took mine back months ago after it ruined my video opportunities on an Alaskan bear watch.", negetive
"I read the reviews on this camera before buying and knew about the firmware update.  As soon as I got the camera, I upgraded the firmware that is supposed to fix the battery issue.  As soon as I start using video the low battery indicater comes on and the camera shuts down.  Also the video it records is saved as mp4 file which even the canon software does not recognize.  None of my video editing software recognizes the files and you cannot save it any other way.The camera does take good pictures and is quick, but the battery issue kills all the positives for me.  I will be sending the camera back.  Canon should stop selling this camera due to its issues.", negetive
"This camera is a fundamentally flawed ripoff. I exchanged it twice before realizing I should never do business with Canon ever again. You can\'t use the video function do to a battery issue, and the firmware update won\'t fix it. Canon should be ashamed for letting this lemon leave their factory.", negetive
"Beware\! Memory card is not included with this camera and this is not made clear in the product description. It took me 20 minutes to try to locate the memory card so that I could operate the camera, thinking I had misplaced or something. Then I realized the memory card was actually not included. Product description should have made that clear. I have never bought a camera without a memory card included ever before. Annoyed that I now have to shop for a compatible memory card, spend more money AND pay for shipping. Had I known beforehand, at least I could have ordered both at the same time to take advantage of the free shipping promotion.", negetive
"I\'ve just received my second Canon PowerShot SX280 HS.The first one had the old firmware which caused the camera to shut down after a few minutes of use in video mode.I returned the camera to Amazon for an exchange. The new camera also has the old firmware. I called Canon Customer Support. The said to ship it to Canon to flash the new firmware, which would take care of the problem. I asked if I could do this myself. Their reply was \"We do not recommend that.\"I am concerned about Amazon selling me this camera which is defective. This is a known problem, and has been well documented on Amazon. My mistake was thinking that enough time had gone by so that only the new firmware cameras would be in stock.The Canon web page has this posted\:How to Identify Cameras that are eligible for the Firmware Update\:Please check the serial number on the bottom of the camera.This firmware update is for products with the following serial numbers.Serial numberProducts whose sixth digit from the left is \�2\� or less\[\*\*\*\*\*2\*\*\*\*\*\*\] , \[\*\*\*\*\*1\*\*\*\*\*\*\] , \[\*\*\*\*\*0\*\*\*\*\*\*\]I now have some accessories that will have to be returned. Unfortunately I bought a SquareTrade 3\-Year Camera Accident Protection Plan for 39.96. I don\'t know if they will give me my money back.This has been an expensive and time consuming process which needn\'t have been. Amazon needs to stop selling the old firmware cameras.", negetive
"I upgraded to the SX280 HS from the 260 HS because I wanted the DIGIC 6 processor and WiFi.  What a mistake\! There is a real problem with the battery life when using the the movie mode. I carry 3 Canon fully charged batteries.  Within approximately 2 minutes after switching to movie mode to record, the battery meter changes from full charge to a flashing red low battery warning. Quickly thereafter, the camera turns off. I turn the camera off then back on and see a full charge state.  However, as soon as I zoom, the flashing red low battery appears and soon shuts itself off if don\'t cycle it off then back on.  I have installed the Canon firmware update but no change in the battery issue.  The still photo mode appears to work without an issue.  Very disheartening and disappointing from Canon.This, in my opinion, would be a fantastic camera if this issue can be corrected.  It has a powerful optical zoom and takes first rate still pictures and videos. Unfortunately, the battery issue makes this Camera impractical unless you carry 3\-4 batteries with you all the time and are will to endure this ridiculous process.  Come on Canon, what are you doing\?  I wish I still had my 260 HS\!", negetive
"I want to inform people that I had the same exact issue in movie mode with the battery indicator AFTER the firmware update.  Not only did the red indicator show up seconds after I switched into movie mode, but 2 seconds after the red indicator flashed, the camera SHUT off \-\- costing me the shot of a lifetime\!  I\'m very disappointed that the firmware did not address this issue.  I returned the first camera and was told it had a faulty battery charger \(that came with the camera\), so I was issued a new camera and charger.  The camera also comes with one battery, so I bought 3 extra batteries and another charger due to the poor battery life \(a separate issue from the battery warning in movie mode\).  While on vacation, I only used one of the chargers \(didn\'t need to charge 2 batteries at a time\), but was constantly charging one battery at a time due to the poor battery life.  Even with all of this equipment and the firmware update, I still had problems.  I wouldn\'t have cared if only the red indicator had flashed \(and yes, it was a fully charged battery\), but the main problem was that the camera shut itself off\!\!  Sure, the camera took great photos in photo mode but I couldn\'t deal with the battery issue which obviously was not resolved so took the second camera back as well.  It\'s too bad that Canon can\'t get the issue resolved because I would have kept the camera otherwise.  I was even considering getting the older version of this camera, the SX260, but read that it also had a really short battery life \(just not the movie mode issue\).  I don\'t really want to have to constantly charge batteries so will see if Canon improves the battery life \(as well as the battery issue in movie mode\) with the next version of the camera, whenever it comes out.", negetive
"Camera was defective. Canon declared it damaged, which I guess it was, but it was defective and the damage arose in frustration with the defect. Canon refused to do the right thing. Rudely.", negetive
"Both know there is a big problem with this camera relating to making a video but both continue to falsely advertize and then sell this camera. I ordered this camera after being very satisfied with an SX230 and wanted the newer model, was I in for a shock. I received the camera at about 2 PM and by 4 PM I had dropped it off at UPS to return it. Camera does NOT take video. While I use the camera primarly as a camera I do want to make some short 1\-3 minute videos when a video tells the story better than a still photo. I put in the battery and it shows being fully charged, take several photos and camera appeared faster than the older SX230 which was one reason for wanting the new model. Switch to video mode and the battery shows almost drained, start taking a video and immediately the battery indicator starts flashing, within a couple of seconds the camera shuts off\!\!\! Turn camera back on, switch to auto photo mode and battery shows full. Try a couple more times with same results so log on to my Amazon account to start the return process. Why both of these once fine companies would continue to not only advertize that this camera can take video and then sell the defective cameras is beyond me. If as Canon has stated there is a \"fix\" by updating the firmware then why don\'t they make sure any cameras being sold have that fix\? Why doesn\'t Amazon make sure they get rid of any old inventory of cameras that do not work properly\? If in fact the firmware updating does not fix the camera then Canon needs to fess up and say camera does not take video. Amazon is a big company and they should make sure that their vendors are honestly advertizing products. If Amazon does not know how to handle this situation perhaps they should talk with one of the companies they recently aquired, Zappos, about how to go about this. Better for Canon and Amazon to get out ahead on this matter before some enterprising attorney starts a class action. Or maybe some state\'s Attorney General or another governmental agency will take issue with the advertizing claims being made on this camera.", negetive
"SAME EXACT ISSUE WITH THE BATTERY INDICATOR SHOWING LOW WITH A FULL BATTERY IN VIDEO MODE. I have been stuck with this camera, since it was gifted to me after it was purchased for a month already. When we contacted canon, they advised us to send it for servicing \(since it was outside the return window\). NO OUT FOR US. SHAME ON YOU CANON FOR NOT OWNING UP TO A MAJOR ISSUE LIKE THIS. RIDICULOUS\!", negetive

"Hi,Bad review for Canon SX280.I am a Canon point and shoot camera lover but sorry to give a very bad feedback for this camera. Canon SX280\! I really do not know how people are giving good feedback for this camera. Pictures are not at all Canon standard. Not sharp, colours are not bright. I mean did not like it at all. I still possess a Canon Powershot SD1200 IS. The picture quality of SX280 is nowhere in comparison with SD1200. Even SX280 design is also bad. The flash is present in a location where most of the people hold the camera and land up blocking the flash from opening resulting in restart of the camera. I returned it immediately.Guys who are really looking for good camera with sharp, crisp, good, quality photo, just not think of buying this camera.\-\- DB", negetive
"Battery gets drained within minutes of starting video recording. Do not recommend at all due to this issue. Otherwise the image quality is descent.", negetive
"Unable to take videos. This is a pervasive problem that Canon hasn\'t addressed. Ordered the camera and when I received it took some pictures which looked pretty good. Then tried to take a video.

"Shame on Amazon for continuing to sell this camera that Canon knows does not work. Software battery problem, even after returning the first. Don\'t buy this camera\!", negetive
"I\'m disappointed about the battery life issue. On Canon\'s website, they say if you have a serial number that has 3 or higher, you don\'t need the firmware upgrade that supposedly fixed the low battery life issue.I bought the camera on January 2014 from Amazon, log time after the issue were supposedly fixed, but I got a unit with a 1 on the 6th digit of the serial number, how is that Amazon is selling old units\?\?I updated the firmware but the unit is STILL defective. Shame on Canon for selling such a lemon. As for Amazon, not sure because no doubt is losing money with all the returns that surely are requested \(unless there is an agreement with Canon trying to dispose off the units still in stock\)The battery problem occurs whenever using the zoom in video mode. Whenever I try and zoom, it shuts down and says \"charge battery.\" You can turn it back on and you will have a full battery, but if you try and zoom with photo OR video, it immediately shuts down.", negetive
"The issue with the battery going out in the middle of a video recording is not fixed as canon claimed. I had a one with a newer serial number but the recording times were still dismal. Canon should recall this defective item. They don\'t seems to care about their customers any more. This will be my last Canon product. I have been a loyal Canon fan since the film camera \"AE\-1\". I have bought canon products for the last 30 years over other brands. Not any more.", negetive
"I brought the camera 4 days and recorded a video for 12 min the camera got hot and the battery got discharged.I Thought that the item that was sent to me may be defective hence I asked amazon to  replace it.They did the replacement very quickly.After receiving the replaced product I recorded a video for 12 min it heated up again.Due the heating issue I have to return both of camera to amazon.Now I am planing to buy a sony camera with the same configuration.", negetive
"I bought this camera simply because of trust. However, the battery problem other reviewers mentioned is real. A few minutes of video, then the camera died. No more shots after turning back on.

"The following review was rejected by the Canon Web Site for the Canon SX280 HS.The Canon SX280 HS Camera is sold new with a known firmware issue, requiring the customer to purchase and install an expensive 32GB SD card, which is not included. Anything new out of the box requiring a repair is a recall item. There are 4 pages of technical instructions to correct the firmware glitch in the camera which shuts the camera down when using the video feature. Canon is aware of this, yet they still have the camera on the market at full price. I bought it yesterday, looked it up last night, saw a list of serial numbers affected, mine was on the list. I looked up price of 32GB SD cards today. I will be returning my Canon SX280 HS to the store it was purchased from \- a Big Box Store. Canon makes the best low light point and shoot cameras on the market, I own 3, but this one is going back. At the very least Canon should be mailing out, free of charge, a 32GB SD pre\-loaded firmware update to anyone who purchased the Canon SX280 HS.", negetive

An off\/on says full battery and I can take stills but no video\?Yes, I have tried all the suggestions that I saw\: Battery and card out for 1 minute and then a half hour  I downloaded the upgrade from the Canon site  etc.Help, I really would like to have the camera operating, will I have to return it\?Thank you.", negetive
"I had a SX260 but upgraded to the 280.  The battery problem is significant.  The camera identifies that the battery is fully drained very quickly after the battery is charged.  We bought a new battery, and the same thing happens.  We\'ve had this for well under a year.  Many other reviewers have posted the same thing.  Unfortunately disappointed", negetive
"Can\'t I choose no stars\? This camera is a lemon period\! Check out Canon\'s own site. There are 80 plus pages of complaints about this POJ. My own experience was the same as all the complaints and more. My camera will not turn on unless I remove\/reinstall the battery. I sent it to canon for warranty and it came back with exactly  the same malfunctions. I can\'t return it because I bought it at Target who has only a 30 day return on cameras. It is amazing they are still pushing this thing. Unknowing people must still be buying it.", negetive
"Purchased here at amazon.com. The camera was great, but DIED after 4 months. Suddenly it turned off with the lens open and did not turn on again. Have to send for repair to Canon, and obviously it is a pain to ship it, fill forms, bla bla bla.... also, the camera gives battery problems, even if you upgrade the firmware, if you shoot video it will display a battery problem and turn off. AVOID this camera. I am a CANON fan, but this model is TO AVOID.", negetive
"The battery problems while shooting video are well documented so I won\'t bore you with the details. It is enough to say that we tried and failed with this camera twice, and the second camera\'s sixth digit was a \"3\". The firmware update \(installed as instructed while on the phone with Canon customer support\) failed to work both times and the camera continued to shut itself down while in video mode. Thank goodness for Amazon\'s return policy. I have now returned both cameras and we are looking at another brand. Very dissapointed with canon.", negetive

I bought the camera for the 1080 movie quality which is useless.  Its not fair to have been sold a product which only provides half its function. I\'ve never written a review or felt the need to until now. This has been the worst experience. I bought this camera in August, I began the process to return it after trying to update the firmware without success.

Called Canon directly after checking online and seeing that this was a common issue \- figured no point in just getting another one from Amazon.

"I bought this camera after reading many positive reviews on professional websites. They all highlighted the camera\'s fantastic picture taking ability, which I completely agree with. However, there is a huge flaw with this camera\'s battery. You will run into many situations where the battery indicator is reading empty but the battery is still fully charged. This would only be a minor inconvenience except that the camera will also shut itself off when it thinks the battery has died \(even though you still have a full charge\). This makes the camera completely unreliable and will cause you to miss many photo opportunities. I missed several shots on my honeymoon because the camera thought it was dead even though I just charged the battery\!If you look hard enough at reviews, you will find this battery problem mentioned by a number of customers. Do yourself a favor and read through this 90\+ pages of complaints about the battery issue on Canons website\: \[...\]Please, learn from my mistake and avoid this camera.", negetive
"This camera has a major glitch that undermines its otherwise fine features. The battery indicator is misleading about the actual state of charge of the battery, both in still shooting and video. More than once the camera has shut down when the battery indicator showed 2\/3 full charge. This has happened after installing the most recent firmware. This glitch effectively significantly shortens the useful life of a battery charge, such that I have found it necessary to carry extra batteries for almost all shooting situations. Even so, I find myself missing shots because the camera begins acting up prematurely. I have contacted Canon and they have dodged my questions about this issue.", negetive

I called them to complain, but they told me that that\'s they way they do things.  Also, the used camera has the same serial number sequence that has problems.  But I\'m not supposed to worry because this camera has will have a 3 month warranty.What a rip off.  To top it off, the camera is \$100 cheaper now, just a few months later.", negetive

"Canon should be ashamed for selling this product which can\'t record video as described.  Read the reviews on Canon\'s own website regarding this camera.  Even after doing the firmware update as recommended it still doesn\'t operate.  When attempting to record a video, the low battery light flashes, even with a fully charged battery.  After 20 seconds of recording it shuts down and a message comes up to recharge the battery.I contacted Canon support and was told that a camera that has a serial number with the sixth digit being 2 or below requires the firmware update and that should correct the problem. My firmware update was done correctly and I\'m sure the reviews of the others that did updates are also correct.  IT DOESN\'T CORRECT THE PROBLEM.  The tech support agent couldn\'t explain except that it must be an internal problem in the camera and I could either send it in for repair or try and and exchange it for a new camera.

"I bought this camera a month ago, and was just checking about returning it and missed the deadline to return it without \$\$\$ penalty by one day.  That sucks and so does this camera.  The zoom is great and it takes nice photos once it decides to focus.  So if you want to spend \$300 for a camera that takes nice pictures go for it.  There is a lot of other camera at half that price that take great pictures thou.  If you want to take movies with this camera forget it\!  They come out nice, BUT, you have like 3 minutes of battery life before it dies when you use the video function.  I bought an extra battery with this and it doesnt matter which one I use or which charger I use, they both die within 5 minutes of using the video function.  Huge flaw in this product.  I can\'t believe it. Its BS.  I\'ve had 4 canon powershots before, and not a single one ever had battery life issues. Its not highly unlikely I will buy another Canon. I\'m also mad at Amazon wanting to penalize my refund because of one day.  That\'s BS.  I ordered the camera before I actually needed it.  How was I supposed to know the battery life while making videos was going to be so horrible\?  I DO NOT RECOMMEND YOU BUY THIS CAMERA.  Its not worth the price.", negetive
"Canon marketing or engineering made some odd choices in this 20x travel zoom.  It competes with the Panasonic ZS30, Nikon S9200 and the Sony HX50.Pros.\- The 12 MP sensor and lens combination is clear and sharp with snappy colors.\- The digital zoom has fewer artifacts than the competition.Cons.\- The camera tends to overexpose and blow out highlights.  It doesn\'t offer automatic exposure bracketing which might avoid this problem \(and will one day be available with the CHDK firmware mods\).\- No travel 20x zoom lens is going to offer wide apertures but this lens has a narrowest aperture of f\/8.  If you attempt to shoot a longer shutter and narrow aperture to increase your depth of field or blur water or action, the camera will blow out the scene.\- The initial battery indicator bug in video appears to have been fixed, but when the 4GB file size limit is reached, this camera stops recording.  If you notice this, you can push the video button and record another 25 min segment.  But there will always be a gap.  Every dash dvd avoids this as do the competition, but not Canon.\- No sweep panorama option available on the competition and most cellphones.\- The WiFi does not have remote control like the competition.\- Focus and exposure is restricted to the center of the image unless the camera detects a face.\- ISO is automatic restricted to 80 on long shutter speed shots.  So if you shot in low light like a club show, the Canon makes it even more difficult to hand hold a useable shot.Overall, this could have been a much better camera with much better software.  Canon made some choices which seriously detracts from the usefulness of this camera.", negetive
"If you are buying this camera for movie mode then don\'t waste your money. There is a major fault with the battery level indicator when in video mode. The battery indicator will appear and the camera will shut off in video\/movie mode but if you eject the battery and start again in photo mode then the battery will show full or near full charge. Canon tried to fix this issue with an updated firmware however I tried this and it did not fix the problem. I would definitely not suggest this camera for anyone interested in video \/ movies.", negetive

"I usually buy all of my cameras \( Canon and Panny addict here\) through Amazon, and have not returned a single one out of the dozen or so purchased over the years. I wished I had done so with my current SX280, for I would have been able to return it and be done with this spawn of Satan.The features and pictures, design and build of the camera are fantastic. Lens is sharp. So what sucks\?The video. If you\'ve read any three reviews in a row here, you\'ll have noticed that the camera shuts down once the zoom button is engaged. The blinking red weak battery icon becomes ever present, and once the zoom button is touched, the camera shuts down after 30 seconds. BTW,  I purchased mine in November 2013, and it had one of the dreaded serial numbers.So I downloaded the firmware and upgraded. Did absolutely nothing.Then I called Canon. They were gracious and had me send the camera in free of charge as it is still under warranty. I got it back very quickly\- within 2 weeks, along with a nice note explaining the problems with the camera and how they fixed it.Only they didn\'t. Same issues. Same red blinking light when the Record button is pushed. Same shut down\- but now 5 minutes instead of 30 seconds later\- unless you try it twice, and then it shuts down after 30 seconds. Really, Canon\? Technicians\?So this is why I\'ve taken the time to write a review. Another reviewer mentioned that Canon was not repairing the SX280,, but replacing them with refurbs.  My guess is that so many have been returned they ran out of replacements and just send the camera back hoping you\'ll go away.  Well. I\'m telling you\- if you get this camera, put it into video mode with a fully charged battery and a class 10 SD card, and hit Record.  Let it go and see if the red battery icon appears, and also zoom in and out. Leave it recording for another minute, and move the zoom button to the right. If it doesn\'t shut down, I guess you\'re ok. Otherwise, you know you have a lemon.Update\: I\'ve contacted Canon again, and they are taking the camera in again to see what\'s up. I will update, as that would be the fair thing to do.2nd Update 3\/14\/14....Canon sent a refurbished model....that didn\'t work either. Can you believe it\? A refurbished model with the dreaded serial \#2 in the sixth number from the left. When I called again and finally got to a supervisor, he wanted me to send the camera back \"for another try\". I kid you not.. The response was so dry and indifferent that I insisted on a new camera this time.. I have two choices, he said. Send it back or wait to have a Canon Corporate Rep call me. \"How long will that be\?\"  They will call you by later this afternoon. That was 2 days ago.I envy all of you folks who bought the camera with no problems. I would love to be one of you. But really\- to send in a new camera\- have them send it back as repaired when it is not\- send it back again, and get a refurb that is broken as well\-and then just say send it back again... I wished I had never had to find out how ineptly and indifferently the Canon service department operates.", negetive
"I\'m so disappointed.  I read all of the reviews about the battery life issue before purchasing this camera.  On Canon\'s website, they say if you have a serial number that has 3 or higher, you don\'t need the firmware upgrade that supposedly fixed the low battery life issue.  So, mine has a 3 in the serial number and I thought it would be okay.  WRONG\!  They are STILL defective.  Shame on Canon for selling such a lemon.  The battery problem occurs intermittently whenever using the zoom at all even in photo mode.  Whenever I try and zoom, it shuts down and says \"charge battery.\"  You can turn it back on and you will have a full battery, but if you try and zoom with photo OR video, it immediately shuts down.  I\'m returning it to Best Buy where I also purchased the 1 year service agreement.  The battery went dead anyway after shooting about 25 pictures.  SERIOUS defects\!", negetive
"\[YET ANOTHER UPDATE\: I\'ve downgraded my review from two stars to one. Why\? Because I tried to offload the photos from a long trip to my computer, and kept getting \"communication error\". I thought the camera was broken. Some internet search indicates that YOU CANNOT OFFLOAD ANYTHING IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN 1000 PHOTOS ON THE CARD. It says you should use an external USB reader, which of course is not included in the package. Is Canon for real here\? In this day and age, with 32GB cards selling for very little, 1000 photos isn\'t a lot. Merely telling people \"communication error\" is a nutty way to get this across, instead of \"Too many photos to offload\", or something actually useful.\]Let me say that this is my fifth Canon camera, and I have always found their products to be a good mix of usability, features, and price points. The 260 came highly recommended and, when the its successor, the 280, came available, I figured it was time to upgrade my prior Canon. This was actually in lieu of the Sony RX\-100, a spectacular camera that unfortunately only has a 3.6x zoom.The 280 takes very good, often great, photos, and the zoom is sometimes astonishing in its ability to pick out fine detail in what seem to be impossibly distant subjects.But this camera should not be sold, and it\'s utterly shameful for Canon to still be doing so. IT IS INHERENTLY DEFECTIVE, and they know it \(or, at least, there is no plausible deniability here, given the dozens of comments on their own site and on Amazon about the same issue\). There are two issues, actually\: battery life, which is bad \(but tolerable\), and the fact that the battery INDICATOR is preposterously inaccurate. You can put in a freshly charged battery, the indicator will SAY it is charged, then, in just 5 minutes, it will flash red, saying the battery is about to die. If you turn it on and off, it will then say it\'s fully charged.If you think this is merely an annoyance, think again\: it will actually stop your video right in the middle. It got to the point where it was stopping the video every three seconds.The camera, in my view, is therefore unusable, and Canon is knowingly selling a defective product. A class action should be brought against them, and Big Box stores like Best Buy and even Amazon, if they had any sort of integrity, should inform Canon that they will not carry this product any longer. It is sad that Amazon and others will suffer a slew of returns for selling this, but IN NO WAY should you even considering purchasing this.And, yes, I did the firmware update. It makes the problem somewhat better, but it hardly goes away.\[Unfortunately, I took this to Europe for a long trip as my only camera, and cannot easily exchange it from here. Also unfortunately, I was a something of a Canon loyalist, but this is really beyond the pale. It\'s the last time I will even consider a product of theirs. This is not accidental, and they should recall every one of these at their own expense until they can produce something that is NOT OBVIOUSLY SERIOUSLY DEFECTIVE. Sorry for the caps, but I did want to make it clear that, if you are still considering this\: Don\'t.\]UPDATE BELOW\:I may have overstated my case\; I\'ve been using the camera intensively for an additional week, and the quality of still photos has been often exceptional, especially using the zoom.The point of my review was to alert potential purchasers to the issue with the video\'s simply stopping in the middle of shooting. This has now happened to me three more times just in the last week. It\'s real\; it keeps happening\; and I, too, did the firmware update.I would also say that I\'ve been carrying two batteries with me every day, and have had to use both every day. This did NOT happen with prior Canon cameras, and those used smaller batteries, so this is an especial battery hog. Let me be clear that I, personally, don\'t really care about that. What I DO care about \-\- and what I feel I made abundantly clear in the review \-\- are\: \(1\) that the camera keeps needing to be restarted just to get the battery indicator to read accurately, which is merely annoying\; and \(2\) that videos will often shut down in the middle, even with a mostly charged battery. This has now occurred MANY times, and it\'s hard to see how this won\'t be a dealbreaker for many potential purchasers.I suppose that, in the end, it comes down to whether one is hoping to use the camera nearly exclusively for still photos. If so, it\'s an excellent, if flawed, camera. If not, and video performance is important, I stand fully behind what I said at the end\: do not even consider it.", negetive

"After 15 months to the day, the screen has large black lines in it. Canon wants \$147 to repair or \$146 for a refurbished one.

I may be out the \$300.", negetive
"I was suspicious when I opened the new in box camera and saw there were fingerprints all over the viewfinder. But since there were no scratches, I thought I\'d just keep it. But now it cannot detect my Sony Vaio computer via wifi, although it detects my husband\'s same model of laptop across the room. When I turn his computer off it can\'t find any computer by wifi. We use the same anti\-virus programs.The software is on my computer. Canon tech support is closed. Will call them tomorrow but if they can\'t solve it I\'m sending it back. Maybe they sent me a lemon.", negetive
"Very disappointed with Canon. I bought mine at Best Buy and had the same issue with the poor battery life, this was even after the firmware \"update\". This is wrong to continue selling a camera that they know has issues, now I know why it was sold at such a discount. It makes you wonder how poor Canons testing is to overlook this huge flaw. I was also not happy with the image quality, I took shots side by side in auto with my five year old Canon SD790 IS and it was much better. In the end I took it back and got the Sony HX50V...it was more expensive but it beats the Canon in every way. The battery life is excellent, I can actually record video and take pictures and go back to recording, and the image quality is better. Shame on you Canon, you took a loyal customer and forced him to another brand.", negetive
"I\'ve purchased two of these cameras in the last year and I\'ve had the same problem with both of them.  1\) the zoom lens is very sensitive, if you get any dust or dirt in the lens area the zoom locks up.  2\)  the input for the charger is very sensitive and the metal prongs get bent very easily and then you will not be able to charge the camera or connect the camera to a PC.  I bought two of these cameras as I thought it was just myself having user error which caused the problems, this is not true, after I bought the second one I was super careful to handle the camera with extra care and I ran into the same problems again.  I called customer service then they we unhelpful which is why I\'m now turning to this customer review.  I at least hope to help others in making a better decision.", negetive
"Hello,  I received this camera as a gift and enjoyed it for about 5 months.  Then the LCD screen cracked. The screen has a screen protector and it was IN the case when this happened.  The crack is not visible on the outside of the screen but clearly it is cracked inside and now is worthless.  I may have to go back to an Olympus camera rather than continuing to put money into a clearly inferior product. One other problem we had was that the camera did not fit well in the case.  It seems like the case we received was for an older model.", negetive
"This is my second Lumix after having Canons.  I had a ZS3 with 12X optical zoom.  I absolutely loved that camera \(a friend dropped it\).  I took a picture once on full zoom out of a plane window of a ship in the water below at least 2 miles away.  It was just a speck in the distance.  I then magnified the image on the camera\'s screen and I could see the color of the ship, how many stacks it had, etc.  It was simply amazing.  Well, I bought this thinking that the 20X zoom would be even better.  It was not, and actually it is nowhere close to the ZS3.  There is something wrong with the focus.  When you zoom on the screen the picture is fuzzy.  I took the same picture with the Z20 and an older Canon. The old Cannon looked much better. This camera may be too technically ambitious.  It has some nice features but they went way over the top and made a mess in the process.I also went to Costco and checked out the Z19 \-\- it seemed to be better, although I had to take a picture in the store and I didn\'t have a direct comparison.I read some other reviews here saying that someone else had the same problem and that Panasonic was updating the firmware.  But I called Panasonic twice and they have no firmware update planned and the reps said they know of no such problem. The firmware on the camera is version 1.0.  I told them about the reviews on Amazon and they clearly didn\'t want to know anything about it.I can\'t live with fuzzy pictures so this camera is going back to Amazon.  Buyer beware.UPDATE\-\-\-\-I have since gone back to Costco to check out the zs\-19 and looked at it more carefully.  The fuzziness was no better than the ZS\-20.  So I ended up replacing my original ZS\-3 with a factory refurbished unit I found online.  It will get me through until Panasonic fixes their issues.  What was also interesting was that several sources online sell the ZS\-3 new for \$4\-500 even though it\'s an old model. The lens was really great on the ZS3.  The later ZS models use some lens tricks to try and get the same results using less lens \-\- this could be an issue.", negetive
"I received this camera for Christmas from my husband. In most of the several dozen pictures we took there was a faint shadow in the bottom corner of the pictures \(slight but undeniably noticeable\). It appears that this is either a design flaw or this particular camera was a lemon. It\'s a somewhat bulky camera in contrast to my older, much more compact Canon Elph I purchased in 2009. Also, unlike that camera, the screen resolution was surprisingly poor. An hour glass even popped up while it delayed processing, which reminded me of the digital camera I bought 8 years ago. I think technology should keep improving in all aspects of the camera, so it felt like a regression using this. Overall, a disappointment.", negetive

"What may be a design defect causes the electronics to fail on this and similar models, which Panasonic will not acknowledge.  When it works it is a wonderful camera, and mine lived for nine months in an air conditioned New York City apartment before it failed.  Panasonic refuses to honor the one year warranty within the warranty period because they determined \"moisture damage\" to a connector on the main circuit board \(a few pins appear to be corroded\), but were not willing to discuss any other design defect that could be the cause.  So, this design will not survive unless used indoors in a dry climate.", negetive
"Rec\'d ZS20  today. Overjoyed\! Had spent a LOT of time considering what pocket camera would be best to complement my SLR\-and\-too\-many\-lenses\-etc kit.  Used it for 10 minutes.  Handed it to wife.  She says zoom doesn\'t work. She\'s right. Suddenly, no control works, not even the off switch\; camera is entirely locked up.No support phone number in the manual so search for it on the Web. I have spent the last two and a half hours trying to reach customer support at Panasonic. I have gone into limbo\; been disconnected\; had the line answered by an operator 3 times\; been answered by one other person who said she is transferring me to the correct agent \(that line has been on hold for 32 minutes at this point\)\; etc, etc\; been asked to enter full model number omitting no letters or numbers, a challenge when calling on a Blackberry, etc, etc\; .  Operator has told me that all the problems are  to a system upgrade.  \(What was it like before the upgrade\? \<joke\>  More seriously, what kind of idiot puts in upgrades to mission critical contact center software during business hours\?\)So I have fully lit up but dead camera\; on\/off doesn\'t even work. It is zoomed and I need to figure out how to unzoom it \(zoom switch doesn\'t work\) so I can fit it into the box and in utter frustration and disappointment return it to Amazon.And now, 37 minutes into my call being on hold I get an agent who tells me that there is no reason this should have happened\; he can\'t explain it.  I ask for a return authorization.  He says they\'ll have it picked up for repair. I say \'unacceptable\'.  He says he will transfer me to 2nd level support. Instead, he transfers me back to the beginning\-\-and \"the voice\" asks me why I am calling.  I tell it \"technical support\" and it says \"sorry\-\-we are now closed.\"The hell with Panasonic. I am really disappointed \- bought this for a trip to the Caymans next week.  It is going back to Amazon tomorrow.PS \- another trio of Panasonic \"joy killers\" \(not misrepresentations or anything, just things that may impact the quality of your experience as a consumer\)\:\(1\) No card ships with camera.\(2\) Battery does not come charged, so when you get excited as you get it out of the box you have to wait 4.3 hours for a charge before you can play with your new camera.\(3\) Manual is provided on CD only \(unless you count all 18 pages of instructions in the \"Basic Owner\'s Manual\"\).Boy, does the excitement fade quickly.UPDATE.  Last night I finally sent them an email saying that it was impossible to call them and I had spent 2 hours trying\; would they be so kind as to call me.  They replied this morning \(12 hour turnaround, not bad for email help request\) but they said \"please call us for assistance\".  I replied \"Please call me\; I was too frustrated by my experience to try to call you guys.\"FURTHER UPDATE.  2 days later, no reply.  I have a return authorisation from Amazon.  Camera has behaved and not locked up again.  Not sure what I am going to do.UPDATE.  Got the replacement\; no problems.  Like the camera very much but no desire to change the rating.FURTHER.  Bought a new laptop and have found that PhotoFunStudio \- the utility Panasonic provides to transfer pictures from the camera to a PC does not work unless you have the font size set, in Windows, to 100\%.  The laptop has a great high res screen and I have it set to 150\% font size in order to get things readable. Panasonic support recommends that whenever I want to transfer photos I change to 100\%, which means I  must then log off \[closing all programs on your desktop\] and log back in.  This is dark ages programming \- pure laziness and stupidity on Panasonic\'s part. I then need to reverse the process when I am done with PhotoFUstudio.  Can I change my review down to a half star\?", negetive
"This camera takes good pictures but there are more issues other than that. When I try to switch from camera to the view the picture there is a 1\-2 minute wait. then when I want to go back to picture taking mode another 2 minute wait. I miss a lot that way.That is to long to wait for it to switch. The GPS is very hard to get calabrated, hard to findsatelites. The date stamping is very slow. I was in Israel and took around 50 pictures one day, I wanted to date stamp them so I set it up to do that. Date stamping takes a long time for that many pictures, so I just got it started and went to bed leftit plugged in to the outlet so so all night it worked and by morning it was still not finished and I had o turn it off because I needed the camera for that day. I lost about 50\% of my pictures. After that as I resumed the use of the camera the problem started with it locking and as described earlier it was very slow in switching from picture to camera mode. I sent it back to MC Allen Tx for repair it was under warranty and they told me nothing was wrong with it. it came back to me and I continued the use of it and it got worse. I decided to just pay for the repair if they would fix it. I sent it back to them, they wante dmy CC and told me it would cost 178.00 to fix. I agreed to do it. 2 weeks later I called and they, they told me that still there is nothing wrong with it but they would have to charge me to inspect it. I paid 250.00 for the camera and they after two tried they are charging me to look at again and tell me that there is nothing wrong with it. I will have to buy another camera but it will not be a Panasonic. I will say it takes superb pictures and vedio. They told me that they might not charge me the total of 178.00 I will wait and see.

"I purchased this camera and after only a few months of owning it the lens cover would not open.  I sent it back to Panasonic Repair and after 3 weeks of waiting and a couple of phone calls, I sent them an email expressing my dissatisfaction with their repair process and responsiveness.  The next day I received a call from them stating they would not honor the warranty due to finding sand inside the camera. I took very good care of this camera, always kept it in a case, never dropped it, etc. No abuse, no misuse, just normal usage for a point and shoot camera. If a grain of sand can make its way into the lens and render the camera irreparable, I guess I consider that a design flaw. If Panasonic will not honor the warranty, I consider that the poorest of customer service.", negetive

I sent the camera in after the shutter stopped working and they wanted to charge me \$180 for repairing this camera worth \$200, claiming I damaged it...

Less then a year after I bought this camera I noticed a spot.

These are the real reviews you need to see because something will go wrong and all you can expect is the worst customer service in the world.  The customer service is just horrible.  Not only do they not honor the repairs, they are rude and snide.The Leica zoom lens gets dust inside that you can\'t get to.  It will show up in your pictures as dark grey spots or lines.  This is a known issue and Panasonic will leave you high and dry.  I sent my camera back twice under warranty.  Within a few weeks of the last repair, the dust was back.  The camera was now out of warranty and they wanted \$180 to fix it.Why would I pay \$180 for them to fix something they fixed three weeks before for free and it didn\'t last.Read reviews on other sites like CNET.com and you will find the same issues with the camera and the same complaints about the customer service.  Panasonic knows there is a problem with dust and still sells the camera without backing up the product.This is my second Panasonic Lumix camera.  The first lasted just over one year.  I was in a hurry to replace it before a trip and since I was familiar with it, I bought another but newer model.  Never again.  If the camera is working, the pictures are great only if you have great lighting, however, you will be very disappointed in low light settings.

Photos there varied wildly in color, often not at all resembling the true color of what I was shooting.  Then the camera started going off randomly.  I got some great pix of the floor of the car, for example.  The answer, which I learned later, was to reset the camera.  I have done so.  Many times, in fact.  This random shooting crops up frequently, resulting in wasted time and disk space.Recently, I found the color to differ wildly from the top of a picture to the bottom,  That problem was solved when my son\-in\-law noticed that my finger, as I held the camera, partially covered the flash.

I now have to hold the camera at the top and bottom with 4 fingers, which does not feel stable to me.It was out of warrantee when I got totally frustrated...", negetive
"I purchased this item to replace a TZ5 \(most excellent camera\) that I lost while hiking.  This camera is nothing like the earlier model in terms of quality.  It does not focus very well at all, and i have missed many great shots due to that.  I miss my TZ5\!", negetive

"The camera lens failed to extend 13 months after purchase, one month after the 12 month warranty expired. The display says \“System error \(zoom\).\”  It was only used on two vacations.  It was not mistreated or used in a harsh environment. Panasonic does not repair it.  Various procedures to extend the lens failed.", negetive
"They use a plastic, off\-center plastic tripod\/mono\-pod mount.And it was proven that a plastic, off\-center tripod\/mono\-pod mount which is used as a camera casing corner piece as well, is destined for trouble.When i took my TZ5 off the monopod yesterday the camera case fell apart because the off\-center plastic tripod\/monopod mount, which is also used as a support for the camera casing, had broken \)\-\;When i called panasonic they more or less stated \"Sorry \'bout that, we only warranty for a year\! Pay for the repair and we\'ll take care of it\"\!No Way\!Yet, i am thankful such happened for i had been considering a ZS20, but now it\'s Canon or Nikon time\!Peace, in spite of the plastic people....... francis", negetive

"I specifically purchased this camera for an extended backpacking trip due to its wide zoom and light weight.  It took good pictures while it worked but after 4 months the display failed.  I have read that this is not unusual with the camera so I sent it in for warranty repair.  I was then advised that there was corrosion found inside the camera and the warranty would be voided as a result.  While it was a very wet early season the camera was not exposed to rain other than an occasional light drizzle.  It was kept in a water resistant case but it was by my side in humid weather as were my other electronic devices such as my cell phone which was probably exposed to more rain but had no issues.  Whether the display failure was related to the corrosion is up for debate.  What is not is that the camera will experience corrosion if kept in humid outdoor conditions for an extended period of time and this will void the warranty.  The camera is not recommended for extended field use.", negetive
"I got a Panasonic camera last year for Christmas, and I just wanted to warn everyone about my terrible customer service experience.  I was very happy with how such nice optics fit in such a small package.  A few weeks ago, I noticed that the flash wasn\'t working and the mode indicator dial wouldn\'t always register the correct position.  Since the camera was still under warranty, I sent it in for repairs.I got a call from Panasonic a week later telling me that the warranty was void because of a small dent on the camera\'s mode indicator dial, and since the dent was in one of my problem areas, they claimed the warranty was void.  There was no dent when I sent the camera in for repairs.Panasonic said that it is their policy to keep the packaging of any package which looks like it was damaged in shipping.  They did not keep the packaging for my camera, since it had shown no signs of damage.  I talked to a number of people at the post office, and they also had no record of damage.  The only logical conclusion left was that the camera was damaged at Panasonic\'s repair facility.Panasonic, of course, insists they do not damage cameras, and that it is not possible for a camera to be even accidentally damaged at their facility.  They told me several times they would have a manager call me back to speak to me about the situation.  No one ever did.  Every time I called again, I was told the manager was unavailable.  I got no help from anyone at their support center.  I only got brushed off.My camera had no dent when I sent it in.  It was sitting untouched on a table between the last time I used it and the time I noticed it was malfunctioning.  Panasonic treated my camera negligently at their facility. Now they want to charge me more than the cost of the camera to have it repaired, when it should still be under warranty.Panasonic sold me an unreliable product, damaged it further instead of repairing it, and gave me terrible customer service.  I will never buy any product or service from them again, and I encourage you to avoid them as well.", negetive
"I just finished packaging up the camera to send it back to Panasonic for warranty work.  I read some other reviews stating this camera was susceptible to getting dust inside the lens but I disregarded them.  I wish I hadn\'t.I now have some dirt inside my lens that shows up as a dark oval shaped distortion in the lower LH corner of the view finder as well as in all the pictures.  Apparently dirt can get inside the lens if you use the zoom frequently.  Anyway, I guess I will get to post a review of the warranty service too later on.When it was clean it took good pictures and excellent video but it\'s useless to me now.EDIT\:The camera was received at the Panasonic facility on 6\/14\/2013.  I did not receive the camera back until 7\/10\/2013.  The warranty claim process was slow and the communication to me throughout the process was non\-existent.Any to the commenter\:  Yes I give the camera 1 star now.  It\'s useless if it will get dirt in the lens with just mild easy use.  Coincidentally, just today my neighbor asked me to take a picture of her and her son on their bikes and it was almost the same camera that she had me use.  Same basic design but an older model with 16x zoom.  That one had tons of crap inside the lens or on the sensor too...it was horrible.  I will surely never buy a Panasonic camera again knowing that they have this design defect and it has not been fixed even though the older models were this way too.", negetive
"Picked this camera up from a Black Friday deal and really wanted to like it. I put it through it\'s paces and alas, it\'s junk. I took over 100 pictures indoors using all settings, all zooms, flash and no flash, and every single one is bad. Whitewashed faces, obnoxious shadows from the flash, yellow flesh tones, and blurred pictures. I didn\'t try it outdoors, but what\'s the point \- I need a good all\-arounder. This one was returned, tried a Nikon P300 which was even worse \(see my \'horrible\' review on that one\), moving on to a Canon SX60 with fingers crossed.", negetive
"At first, I loved this camera, it took great shots.  It had all of the features I was looking for.  I used the camera on a Caribbean cruise  and it worked perfectly.  The next time I tried to use the camera, the inside of the camera looked like broken glass.  There is no evidence of damage or mishandling on the outside of the camera whatsoever.  The camera was placed in a quality padded case and never left my sight.  The camera was sent to Panasonic to be repaired or replaced.  They sent me back an e\-mail for repair that would cost 363.88\!\!\!  I purchased the camera from Amazon on April 2nd for 286.00 which included tax and shipping.  When I called to complain, they said that the numbers were wrong and that the actual cost would be around 180.00 \(WOW\!\!\)  I thought about just replacing the camera, but now I see that the price of the camera has risen to 399.00 on Amazon.  I am terribly unhappy with the service and treatment from Panasonic, and I will probably never purchase anything from them again\!\!\!  Buyer beware\!", negetive
"Panasonic has a quality issue with these cameras.  I ordered one after seeing a good overall review score.  I had hoped to get a good unit.  The first unit came and no matter what I did I could not get a nice clear picture.  I tried all kinds of settings as suggested in different reviews here.  So I gave up and set it back for a replacement.  When the replacement showed I took a quick set of pictures.  Low and behold the first shot was much cleaner.  I was happy... but... only the first shot.  Once again it took all lousy pictures.  I even took it to a family member who has a DSLR and knows all the proper setting for lighting and such.  He could not get this second unit to take a clear picture.  So... on last chance.  My wife purchased a Fuji Film camera \(dont have model \# handy\) and I took side by side shots of them both in Auto mode.  What a difference... the Fuji was taking pictures as I would expect a \$300 camera to take.  There was no comparison.  I would avoid the Panasonic unless you like to keep sending them back until you get a good one.  I wanted to love it... but hated it.", negetive
"Bought the Panasonic Lumix DMC\-ZS20 camera from Amazon about a year ago.  At first it seemed okay overall, though I noticed a slight problem with oranges appearing yellow in pictures of sunsets. Then in July 2012 I went on a trip to the upper peninsula of Michigan where I took hundreds of pictures outdoors.  After a couple of hundred pictures a dark brown spot started to appear in the middle of the left side of every new image taken. Now there is a large blurry area in the upper right of every new image as well. So the camera has become useless. I am especially disappointed because I had a Panasonic Lumix DMC\-ZS1 for a couple of years and it always worked great. When I lost the ZS1 in May 2012 I thought I would try another Lumix, but I regret it now.  I cannot recommend the ZS20, though I would still recommend the ZS1. In the end the ZS20 cost about \$1.50 for each of the approximately 200 good images I obtained while using it. From my experience, the ZS20 is a waste of time and of money\!", negetive
"I have never written a review of anything.  The pictures this camera took were not clear.  Also, within one week of buying this camera, the lens no longer opened. Tried to return this to Canon but was told it was non\-repairable and my only remedy was to buy a new version for \$20 more than the purchase price.  Also bought warranty protection offered through Amazon, but the rep for that company has already hinted that they won\'t cover damage if Canon was supposed to cover it.", negetive
"I should have looked at this cameras features before I bought it. I don\'t buy a camera that does not have some form of optical image stabilization. This camera has a cheap form of image stabilization which is near useless\! The camera takes three shots and combines them for a \"blur free\" picture. I went out on a sunny day and snapped dozens of photos using this feature and NOT ONE was sharp or clear. But I wanted to give this camera a decent try before posting a review telling other people to look elsewhere for a camera,don\'t buy this one\! I went out and used no zoom no digital zoom just a standard wide angle on a sunny day. For a 16mp camera these photos were grainy like 1600 Asa film. This camera fails big time in all areas. And I am no amateur. I have had camera since I was nine. I have a Nikon coolpix p90 and a canon powershot SX10 IS, and a kodak easyshare Z1085 iS. Photos from the easyshare Z1085IS which is only 10mp looks a hundred times sharper than this camera. I don\'t recommend camera. And I cannot understand how so many can claim it takes good photographs\?\? My advice if you want sharp photographs the camera must have optical image stabilization. Don\'t go for digital image stabilization it\'s cheap and it doesn\'t work", negetive

"my first disappointment was taking it out the the shipping case\: no protective cover for the camera no instructions \(yes instructions are on line, all zillion pages of disclaimers etc.\)the flash takes too long to load\/charge making it impossible to shoot quickly.while shooting the camera switched to some unknown mode which made replay and download of the pictures impossible.I will return it\!", negetive
"AMAZON OWES ME THE 8G SD CARD\!  No where in the initial description of the item for sale did it make clear that we had to also go in and click on the SD card itself in order to get the SD card free\!\!\!\!When I got the camera, of course, NO SD CARD\! so I go back and then CAREFULLY read the info, including clicking the SD Free Card offer and only THEN do I find I was supposed to separately place this item into the cart to buy at same time\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!Why wasn\'t the damned SD card just included automatically so we didn\'t have to do anything to get it\?\?\?\? That is what I was expecting\!\!\!\! I WANT MY SD CARD\!", negetive
"I was somewhat disappointed in this camera.  The resolution is not that good and the pixels show grainy in low light \- not even dark.", negetive
"This camera takes average pictures.  If you want any kind of action shots, or even if you want to take more than one picture of something, this is NOT the camera for you.  The flash takes a long time to ready between shots.", negetive
"this did not come with the free memory card that was advertised as being part of my purchase of this camera.Furious there is no way to speak to someone directly about this.", negetive
"This camera is the pits. I have yet to figured out how to take pictures with it. There were not instructions telling me how to operate it in a simplified form.I finally found a notation on the packaging to the 228 page instruction manual could be download on Canon web site. Which id in such fine print I need to use a magnifying glass along with my normal reading glasses.To be honest if I had retained the original packing materials this Camera can with I would have returned it for credit.", negetive
"This camera has more pixels than my Powershot Elph 100HS \(16 as cmpared to 12.12 mp\) but the pictures are fuzzier than my Elph. Beware of \$100 cameras\! I can see the main problem is the tiny lens \(is it glass or plastic\?\). We returned this and bought a Nikon Coolpix S9300 which is twice the price but ten times the camera because of the bigger glass lens and sharper pictures.", negetive
"My girl friend  bought  this  camera  for  me  knowing  my  preference  in the past  for  Canon optical  viewfinders and AA batteries. Unfortunately while  on  a  trip where  replacement  was impossible the thing began  to overexpose in  snapshot mode and no adventuring  in  its program  subfolders  could  stop the  problem. Movie mode  remained  ok so......I have  a movie  camera going  back  for  repair\/replacement. On the other hand I give  Canon  credit  for having a  very  responsive  customer  contact  staff. Tune in later for the  outcome.", negetive
"It is rare that I find a product so utterly useless for the intended purpose. I just wanted something to take pictures mostly inside and when the pictures are not fuzzy they are washed out with the flash. The only time it works as one might expect is on bright sunny days outside to take pictures you might with the phone camera, the rest are grainy, fuzzy, and just not worth bothering.It also blows through batteries like nothing I have ever seen.This was an impulse buy, so this is on me. It now lives in a drawer and my old old 4MP is back on the job and doing better than this ever will.", negetive
"I always loved the Canon PowerShot series that took two, AA batteries.  They were a good size, high quality, made of metal and inexpensive.  Plus, batteries were easy to find and I didn\'t have to carry a wall charger with me.This new version, while a little smaller, feels like it\'s made of cheap, lightweight plastic.  It\'s lens movement is slower and less responsive.  It\'s video is of poor quality and the operation is sluggish and awkward\/difficult to do quickly.  I am very displeased with the direction in which Canon has gone.  I have two different, previous versions which I still use today and will continue to use.  I guess this new camera would be ok for a kid, as others have said in review.  I am so, so, so disappointed.", negetive
"HORRIBLE product. I returned it almost immediately after setting it up. I know it is a cheap camera, but it wasn\'t even worth the \$90. It has no memory so you must have a memory card to save a picture. The photos always came out very dark. The only decent thing about it was the zoom, but even that isn\'t worth keeping it.", negetive
"so you get exactly what you pay for\!their is no cable for data transfer to your PC.Thank you.", negetive
"This camera is made with cheap, lightweight plastics, and does not seem as though it will last more than a few months. The battery must be replaced often, which is a problem when the cap for the battery chamber is flimsy and difficult to align. Worst of all, the software for downloading the pictures is pretty awful, and after several hours trying to work it out, we\'re still not finding success. Will perhaps give it another hour of our time, but this camera will very likely be returned.", negetive
"Update 12\/24\/2013I\'ve had this camera for a couple of months and can now say that this is THE WORST camera I\'ve ever used \(and I\'ve been into photography for over 50 years\). It just takes a lousy picture \- 80\% are out of focus indoors or outdoors. Don\'t waste your money on this camera\!I would not normally purchase this level of camera. However, my other camera failed and I needed a \"quick and dirty\" cheap replacement and it had a viewfinder.\(which I find essential for outdoor shooting\).  As other reviewers have noted\; the focus is very soft and the flash takes forever to recharge.I would have rated it 3 stars, however, I also suspect that the camera \(Sold on Amazon by Tri State Camera\) was an \"Open Box\" item, as it was not sealed and did not come with a warranty card.", negetive
"I have always respected the Canon name for cameras and was looking forward to having one, even if it is a lower\-end camera. I was so disappointed in the quality of the pictures that I returned it within a couple of weeks. The final reason I decided to send it back was when I tried to view a video on my computer and it was totally blurred. One video was fine, the next one like looking through a piece of plastic.", negetive
"I do not like this camera, its battery operated and drains batteries way too fast.  The shutter is slow and the pictures are not that clear.  I was not impressed with this camera and quality of Cannon is just not there in this one\!", negetive
"I have been a Canon fan for many, many years. I have, and still use, a Canon 35mm SLR and my old Canon PowerShot A520 has traveled all over the world with me. Having said that, I must also say that the A1400 is a pathetic device. The only feature that works well is the viewfinder, which was one of the reasons that I bought this camera. It is made of such flimsy material that I was almost afraid to even pick it up lest I somehow break it. The time between shots is so long that were you to take several photos of your puppy it would look like time\-lapse as the dog grew\! I sent it back.", negetive
"I saw a reveiw where you were asked if there was a cord to go in a laptop, and you responded YES. I never got the cord.", negetive
"Im not satisfied with this camera. My phone takes better pictures. I\'m going to return it. I have a Nikon Cool Pix that is old but the Nikon is still better. The Canon also feels cheap like it would break easily.", negetive
"I owned an earlier version of this camera which I loved. I HATE this version. Focusing is impossible and switching between modes at will is obnoxious. Very disappointed. I want a camera with batteries I can change readily so that is why I tried this one. FAILURE", negetive
"I bought this on sale but it was still a \$70 camera so I thought it would be pretty nice. The last camera I bought was \$40 and was much nicer than this one.  80\% of the pictures it took came out blurry and it sometimes took 10 to 15 seconds to actually take the shot which sometimes made me miss what I was trying to take a picture of. It has very few settings and its will sit for a few seconds saying its \"charging the flash\". For how cheaply made this camera is it should have been priced at \$20. Highly disappointed with this purchase.", negetive
"I would not recommend buying this camera. When the camera arrived it seemed to work fine and abruptly when I was on vacation in Atlantis Paradise Island I went to turn on the camera and nothing. Camera now doesn\'t even turn on. I initially thought it was the batteries so I replaced them and it still doesn\'t work. I received this camera last week and now it doesn\'t even work. Due to me being on vacation and around water I took extra precaution to make sure that it didn\'t come in contact with any water or that I didn\'t accidentally drop the camera. I was so disappointed in this camera. Do not buy\!\!\!", negetive
"Sorry, I don\'t own this camera. Mine is a Canon PowerShot SX10IS. Now that one is a nice camera. So I don\'t know what to say about the A1400. I am wondering why Amazon wants me to review a camera that I never purchased.", negetive

"I\'ve owned 2 previous Canon Powershots, both Elph versions, and I loved them. My last one stopped working last summer so I purchased this camera based on the Amazon reviews. It takes FOREVER to get the shot because the minute you try to snap the shot, it says \"flash charging\". I miss the picture practically every time. While I do have a Nikon DSLR, which is hands down my favorite camera, it\'s not practical to carry around with me. I love having a point \& shoot to just throw in my purse. I will definitely spend a little more \$\$ and do a little more research before buying my next one.", negetive
"Does not include USB cable. Does not include AV out cables. Both of these were included with previous versions of the PowerShot Axxx line of cameras.Does not include memory card, not even a small starter card.I have liked Canon cameras from the past days, but this is getting ridiculous.
