"Got this yesterday and like it, had before. Just to note, PowerShot A2500 is an entry\-level pocket camera which is very similar to PowerShot A2300\: 16\-megapixel 1\/2.3\" sensor, DiGiC 4 processor, and 5x zoom 28mm wide angle lens, 2.7\" LCD. Even 720p HD video capabilities are the same.Pros\:1. What really distinguishes it from its predecessor is Smart Auto Mode recognizing 32 shooting environments and adjusts settings for better quality. It automatically selects the best shooting settings for optimal quality based on the environmental factors \(lightning I guess\) to provide point\'n\'shoot simplicity.2. 16.0 Megapixels, with loads of resolution pictures are still clear. High resolution is also good for producing biggest printouts.3. 5x Optical Zoom is sufficient in most cases.4. DIGIC 4 Image Processor. Not as fast as DIGIC 5 though fast and powerful enough to give you advanced system options, provide quick\-shoot with reliable performance and low battery consumption. As far as I know DIGIC 4 is currently Canon\'s most efficient processor for budget cameras. BTW it has some Eco mode, that is said to be providing even faster warm\-up times and saves the standard battery, but I haven\'t tested it yet.5. Very lightweight, just put it into your pocket, can take it everywhere.6. Price tag \- \$99. You can\'t get any better camera for the price.Cons\:1. Like A2300 it lacks optical image stabilization, though it\'s got digital image stabilization.2. 1\/2.3\" sensor. Well, entry level CCD providing good pictures, not of a DSLR quality, that\'s all I can say.Summary\:Sure this is not the best camera in the world. I definitely knew it when I bought the camera. BUT, I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of pictures I shot.If you\'re like me \(not a pro\) and looking for a budget point\-and\-shoot camera taking family photos and events, mostly shoot in daylight or good lighting, I\'d definitely recommend it, taking into account its price tag of \$99 \- just about right.", positive
"This is my 6th point and shoot \(P\&S\) camera in 9 years, ranging in price from \$200\-\$300. I have had 1 Bell \& Howell, 3 Nikons and this is my 2nd Canon P\&S camera. The last 2 P\&S cameras I had I literally wore out by taking so many pictures. I bought this as a second camera for my husband \(who doesn\'t usually take pictures\) to use when he goes hunting with my son. I chose a Canon because I have a Canon DSLR and love it. I also wanted an inexpensive camera, because I thought it would sit on the shelf for most of the year. Of course it did not come with a memory card, as I have yet to buy any camera that does.To test this camera, after shooting indoors for a bit, I took it to the park. Luckily, what started out as a sunny day turned cloudy, allowing me to test the camera in different lighting. This is a typical low priced P\&S camera.  Like all P\&S cameras, this one performs best in bright, outdoor lighting. However, the ease of use and quality of pictures for the small price tag makes this a good buy. This is one of the better P\&S cameras I have had.Although no instruction manual was in the box \(other than the very basics\), it was easy to figure out how to manually set this camera, which is a must for me. I liked the fact that it has a PROGRAM setting, which allows me to set a program manually. Even if I switch to another setting, it saves my manual settings, allowing me to switch back and forth between settings. That was great when I tested it, because the lighting went from sunny to cloudy and back again. I could easily switch from AUTO to LANDSCAPE to PROGRAM \(my manually programmed settings\) and back, depending on lighting and activity, all while holding my 6 month old. The pictures I took while holding my baby \(who was trying to grab the camera\) of my 4 other children who were riding a moving train turned out surprisingly good. I also manually adjusted the ISO to 1600 and took some shots while holding my squirming baby, and the pictures were not as noisy as I thought they would be.This is a great camera for the price. I would definitely recommend it for anyone, especially those who are ready to do some manual adjustments to get better pictures, but not ready to spend a lot of money. I am glad I bought this camera, and I am happy because I think I will actually use it more than I originally thought\!", positive
"The camera takes excellent pictures and videos, the price... you can\'t go wrong. I just wish it came with a cable as well to transfer pictures to my PC, instead of having to remove the SD card. This does not come with a memory card, i bought a \"Transcend 16GB Class 10 SDHC Flash Memory Card \(TS16GSDHC10E\)\" together with this and it works well. The camera is very lightweight, and does not look nor feel as though it can withstand any small fall for shock impact, so be careful with it.Ok an edit to my review\: I just tried taking pictures of the moon and venus phenomena \(08\-09\-13\) and i realized that this camera zoomed up to 16times\! Not just up to x5\! After x5 it kept going, x8...x10....x16\! I got an awesome pic at x16 of the moon and the planet.", positive
"IT IS EASY TO USE AND THE QUALITY OF THE PICTURES IS AMAZING.  I DON\'T THINK THERE IS A BETTER CAMERA  IN THE PRICE RANGE OF THIS ONE.  JUST SPENT 12 DAYS IN ITALY AND TOOK OVER 1000 PHOTOS THAT ARE LIKE POST CARDS.", positive
"Bought this little camera at Wal\-Mart for 99.00.  Very pleased as a amateur photographer just wanting the occasional picture to put on my computer.  Thanks to Canon.  They make good products.", positive
"This is my first digital camera and it\'s so easy even I can take great pictures. I especially like that I can take stills and videos with the same camera.  I highly recommend this camera.", positive
"As a long time Canon compact camera user my favorite new features on the A2500 are...The Canon PowerShot A2500 does not just stop at taking images but is rather adept at handling videos as well. It is capable of producing 720p HD files at the touch of a button. One of the thoughtful things about this camera is the inclusion of the movie button. You do not have to fidget about with all sorts of controls in order to get the video going. Rather you go back to that simple button and the rest is history.Another nice feature is that this product is newly minted with an ECO mode which is designed to reduce the power consumption on your camera.The Canon brand has made cameras its specialty and the Canon PowerShot A2500 holds true to type. This model brings out all the features that you would expect of a camera of its class but has the added advantage of making it easier for the consumer to access those features. In other words you get the best of both worlds with a great camera and easy usage.Verdict\:There are no major surprises with the Canon PowerShot A2500. It is a great camera that does what it says on the box.If you are looking for the next model up check out the Canon SD330 as it has another level of features and quality.http\:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00B5HE3UU\/ref\=as\_li\_ss\_tl\?ie\=UTF8\&camp\=1789\&creative\=390957\&creativeASIN\=B00B5HE3UU\&linkCode\=as2\&tag\=stupisms\-20", positive
"The best pocket camera on the market for the price\! There are 3 different cameras by Cannon in this category, go with the A2500 for added overall quality for just a small increase in price\! I had been looking at point \& shoot cameras, reading all the specs. along with remarks by other customers for about 3 months. I got this for my wife for her birthday and she is very picky after going through 3 previous cameras unsuccessfully, she has been very happy with this one\(finally\)\!", positive
"I bought this camera for my son for his 12th birthday because of the price and the fact that I have an older model Canon Powershot that I love.  I was disappointed when I received the camera.  It is very lightweight, to the point of feeling very cheap.  My son really liked it though, very easy to use.  The wrist strap that comes with the camera is not adjustable so it does not tighten on your wrist.  We were in a cave in Colorado three days after he received it and he was taking a picture and the camera slipped out of his hand and since the wrist strap was not tightened on his wrist, it fell to the rock floor and broke.  I called Canon to see about getting it repaired.  It was a minimum \$89 plus shipping to and from.  The camera cost me \$85 including shipping thru Amazon.  Obviously this was no one\'s fault but my son\'s \(although obviously he did not intend to drop it\) but I don\'t know why a reputable company like Canon would cut such a cheap corner on their wrist strap and not make it adjustable.  I called Amazon to see if by any chance they would let me purchase a new one a a reduced cost, not expecting them to let me, and understandably so.  The Amazon rep sent me a brand new camera with free shipping and even sent a pre\-paid UPS label to return the broken camera.  I have always been so impressed with Amazon\'s customer service.  The camera is alright, takes good pictures, but definitely buy a better wrist strap for it.  But so grateful to Amazon for replacing this for us\!", positive
"I have had other small digital cameras, but6 this one is much easier to use.  The buttons to turn it  ON\/OFF are not tiny,.the Menu is clear. Everything is great about this tiny little camera.  The photos are very good.Evelyn", positive
"For the how much it is, it takes quality photos. I would recommend this camera to someone that like to point and shoot.", positive
"Excellent camera for the money. A memory card is not included so you will want to purchase one of those also if you do not already have one. The picture quality if very good and the camera a easy to use.", positive
"Perfect for the occasional photographer that want\'s a quality camera at a fair price.  Easy to use and to produce a quality photo.", positive
"I work in real estate and need a camera that is compact, simple and get\'s the job done. This is the camera\!\! Easy to adjust the settings and takes great pictures. Battery life is good. One thing, it doesn\'t come with a USB cable to sync to your computer. Easy fix, just take take the memory card and insert into your desktop or cpu. Or spend a few dollars to buy the cable on amazon.", positive
"Very happy with the product\!\!\! thanks for everything\!\!\!\! I am very pleased with the product, I\'ll be in touch for future shopping, receive a hug from Venezuela...", positive
"its so collllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll i like it all the time i take it with me beacuse ilove itthank you sooo", positive
"A2500 replaced a more expensive Canon I got through Amex rewards. While traveling on the train or on the street in Manhattan I lost it.. It was very sleek and slippery LOL  Time went by, I found the need to have a camera beyong iphone, ipad. I ordered this camera and I am learning how to use it.What I have found is that I need to learn about\: no blur, MACRO \(close up\) \-\-for novices like me. I need  wide lens features and the ability to fade out unwanted subject in the background.. I have not learned how to use all the features. I have taken very nice shots and not so nice shots experimenting. I find that sharpness is something to be explored in the manual. I am sure Canon tries to keep cost down by not providing a printed out manual but I wanted one and I did the unthinkable\:\-\- printed it out\! put it in a three ring  binder\! old school I guess\! I can point and shoot as described in the product section of this listing. This camera is a nicely priced one and If I should get careless again only this time drive over it\!, well it won\'t cost me an arm and a leg to replace\!.. The manual consists of 109  pages\! That means there is a lot to learn\! I went to manual websites to see how much a manual would cost to buy. The manual service charges between \$12.95 plus the shipping cost\! and up.I had the typing paper and the ink so I printed it out\!Hope this helps you\! I am already researching another Canon digital 16 mega because I need close ups of moving animals\! i.e. parrots\! I would add I bought a .99cent cable UBS cord \(reviewed\) and two extra batteries from Clearmax and an extra battery recharger. The clearmax battery charges in one hour. The Canon battery that came with this camera charges in 21\/2 hours. I bought a SD HC device\/card 16GB.  Remember\: the SDHC card DOES NOT come with the camera. I am going to get a case and more accessories for my camera. Hope this helps\!  from a newbie", positive
"My daughter did some extensive research on digital cameras and decided to buy the Cannon PowerShot  A2500.  This was a Christmas gift for her dad.  Happy to say, he loved and he uses it everyday.  Great camera for the price.", positive
"This camera was the perfect fit for me.I don\'t know a whole lot about photography, but taking a class in highschool taught me a lot.I really like it because you can take action photographs with relatively little blur. Just set it to program and choose the settings that you think will make the picture look good, your intuition is probably better than the cameras. Turn on the grid, so that you can easily find the center of a photograph. I take a lot of outdoors pictures and I really like the way they turn out.", positive
"This is my third Canon camera I have had in the last fifteen years and I love them all.  They are simple to use and the pictures are beautiful.", positive

I only have a 16gb card inside and it says i can store \>3500 pics at max quality. I mean, do you really take that much before transferring to a drive\? so cheap too. worth the money.", positive
"This is the second camera I\'ve received and love it. The first camera came without the charger in the box and no memory card which I was promised in my initial purchase.I have no problems with this camera and just downloaded the user\'s manual to learn all the different settings I need to know about. I\'ve got the time and date set, and I\'m ready to take birthday pictures this weekend as well as some things I\'m going to be selling on Craigslist.I would recommend this model of camera for anyone who just wants to \"click and shoot\".", positive
"We got this for my Dad for Christmas and he loves it.  It small enough to carry around and holds a lot of photos.  We bought him cords\/adapters to hook directly to his iPad so no more messing with Kodak software\/updates, etc.  So easy for him to use.", positive
"Got this for my daughter since it was relatively well priced but still a name\-brand with all the features she needs \(automatic still pics \& video clips\).  It\'s very easy to use.  Love the dedicated video record button.  The pictures come out great.It\'s a wonderful compact size and very light.  The only thing I\'d want changed on it is to have AA batteries.", positive
"I just got the camera today and I love it. It takes sharp pics and the auto mode is excellent. The one thing I noticed right away is how light it is. It doesn\'t feel as sturdy I I would like but that\'s just because of its light weight design.", positive
"I had this on my wish list for a couple of years. It was almost 200 at that time. I forgot it was there and never purchased it. I was looking for a camera to purchase for my  boyfriend as a gift and came across this. He absolutely loves it. The photographs are crisp and clear, and the stabilizer is the best I\'ve seen in any other point and shoot camera. I highly recommend this to everyone.", positive

I can\'t use it because amazon didn\'t send me the free disc \& camera case. that was supposed to come with it. i didn\'t realize i had to add them to the cart. i thought they were automaticlly sent with the camera as they were advertized as free with purchase of the camera", positive
"I bought this as a gift for my thirteen\-year\-old nephew. He loves the camera, and his family does, too. His mom reports that it takes better pictures than her iPhone camera, so the parents borrow it often. He learned to use the features quickly and is very careful with it. The red color distinguishes it for him. I am pleased.", positive
"The camera is exactly what I wanted.  The only problem I had and it was my fault, It didn\'t come with memory. I had to purchase that extra, but still a great camera thanks", positive
"The only qualm is that the on and off button is too easily turned on, by accidentally bumping it or in the act of putting the camera away. If the button had been recessed a bit...it would be better\! Otherwise it\'s great\!  Lightweight, intuitive, and great images. Recommended", positive
"Great gift for young enthusiasts.  Easy and fun to use.  They carry it with them and take pictures of everything.", positive

"I\'m not much of a photographer.  I like to take pictures once in a while, and I want them to turn out well when I do.  I had a much more advanced digital camera for several years, and I could never quite get the hang of it.  Too many settings and options for me.This arrived earlier today, and the battery charged very quickly using the included charger.

"I needed a small little camera to carry around in my pocket and this camera filled the bill just right.  I wasn\'t expecting the same quality that my DSLR gives me, but I have to say I\'m impressed so far with the stills and movies I\'ve taken so far.  For those of you that seem to have problems getting good results I have to say you need to read the manual before blaming the camera.\*\*update 3\/5\/14\:I think all this type camera would have this problem, but I experienced huge LCD washout on outside shots even with the display brightness turned all the way up.  It was so bad that even on a cloudy day \(snow on the ground which I know doesn\'t help\) I had problems seeing the picture I was about to take.  When I reviewed the photos inside they turned out fine.  But I couldn\'t see well enough to frame the picture they way I would want.I didn\'t change from my 5 star rating because, like I said, I think all these cameras would have the same problem.", positive

"Easy to use, fast to set up, compact, couldn\'t be happier.  BTW, you can load the pics using just the flash memory card \(I bought the SanDisk Ultra 16 GB\)  I was worried I wouldn\'t be able to load the pics to the computer without the \(not included\) UCB cord.  The software tells you it \"needs\" the cord to select the right and appropriate yada yada...but that is not true because if you put the memory card into the computer the pictures load.", positive

It does not require batteries because it has a rechargeable one. It has a good zoom lens. It is small and easy to carry.

This new Camera has most of the important features in it that my old camera had. The features that it lacks I really won\'t miss too much. A few of the features that it has were not listed in the description so I feel I got a better deal than I expected. I\'m more than happy with this purchase.

I purchased for my wife\'s birthday and I wanted to get her a camera that was easy to use and took great pictures.  This product does just that.  not only does it take great pictures but also takes excellent video, up to an hour using the 16 GB memory card.

What was that for\? With all or the scams like with Target and all I would like to know what it was for\?  Thank You.", positive

"This was a Christmas gift for my husband. He doesn\'t like change so I wasn\'t sure he would give up his old bulky camera, but he did and loves this new one.

"I purchased this camera to photograph our Christmas this year and it worked just described as an excellent deal for \$60.", positive
"My 6\-year\-old wanted a camera for Christmas but I didn\'t want to waste money on a \"kiddie\" version. I wanted something easy for her to use and understand, but one that she could use for years to come.  This camera fits the bill. Very simple to use. She can now take pictures, videos, and is able to review and delete all on her own. The quality of picture is what you would expect from a point and shoot camera. Happy with my purchase and so is she.", positive
"A lot of my friends can\'t believe how crisp the pictures are even in low light conditions.  I have taken crisp pictures of small birds utilizing the zoom function.  For a low end camera, it takes very good pictures.  It pays to read the manual AND experiment with the function settings.  For example, there is a setting for low light conditions \(which may trigger the flash\) but I have found that changing the ISP speed to 1600 can give nice clear pictures in low light without a flash.  It pays to experiment with this camera since the correct settings result in brilliant pictures.  One really needs to take a lot of pictures of one subject in the same setting to get a good idea how these settings work.  Once you grasp the proper settings, the pictures are excellent\!", positive
"fast shipment and wonderful camera to use.  Highly recommend this camera for it\'s price.  Was a perfect christmas gift to buy", positive

"Camera works great, easy to use. Clear and vivid pictures.When I purchased this camera on December 14th  the add also stated that it would come with a free memory card and case.  You were to click on the card and case to add to the order.  I did that.  I did not receive either one.  When I called Amazon the young man I spoke to asked his supervisor about it.  The supervisor stated that It was not an option on the add.  I said I didn\'t expect it to be on there now since the camera dropped in price.  However, that\'s what was offered when I purchased it.  I also advised them to check the reviews, I was not the only one with this complaint.  Just out of luck I guess\!\!\!", positive
"I was looking for a small easy to use camera. I saw this one and it met all my needs. I\'ve only had it a short time but it takes beautiful clear pictures. Very easy  to use and handle. I love it and would tell people to buy", positive

"This was purchased .as a gift for my youngest grandson. I tested it first charged the battery inserted the SDHC card and took several pictures. I liked the unit, small light weight great pictures. And the grandson was very surprised and excited about it. I rate it a Good buy at a good price.", positive
"If you are a novice picture as I am, why buy anything else\? Drawback\: it is difficult for me to hold the clip lever open while I am inserting the memory card. That is because I have a damaged left hand. I had to get a lady neighbor with long fingernails to insert mine. Smile\!", positive
"This is the first camera I have owned in many years and it fits in my pocket so I can have quick access. It came with a cover which I truly appreciate. When I move the focus sometimes I end up with grainy pictures or blurry and for some reason it takes a few extra seconds to focus. I have missed some good shots because of that.  Another problem I had was not realizing what I clicked on that caused multiple shots and that was strange. I am still not sure how I fixed it either. However, overall for me and my qualifications, this is a good buy.", positive

"This was a gift and the camera is very good for the low price I got it for. The pictures are nice.", positive
"I love that I have a camera again\; this is more sophisticated than my previous camera, better focus, more user friendly, lighter and I love having a battery to recharge instead of having to buy double A batteries. What really chafes me, though, is that I had to pay \$16 for a cable to upload photos to my computer \-\- Kodak gave you one with the camera purchase, and I think it\'s kind of cheesy for Canon not to supply one. BTW, the one I got was at Staples, someone said it had to be one made by Canon, not true, this works perfectly. I was lucky to find this when Amazon was running a deal where you got the memory card for free, I expect to have to pay for the memory card, but not the cable.", positive
"Bought this for my granddaughter\'s 11th birthday.  She loves it\!\!  It\'s a very nice camera for not a lot of money.  She showed me photos and videos that she\'s taken of the dogs playing and sleeping\!  Small size makes it easy to slip into a pocket\-\-perfect for a trip to Disney World or any vacation.", positive

"I just love my Canon PowerShot... It is small but powerful.  It takes wonderful pictures and the detail is awesome.  It is easy to use.  I would recommend this camera to anyone.", positive
"This camera is a little slower than my 8MP Canon \-\- but, the pictures are so well defined that you can crop a picture \(taken from 100 yards away\) and it isn\'t blurry when enlarged.  I like this camera \-\- easier to adjust the distance than my other Canon.", positive
"My wife is a teacher and needed a small camera to capture those special moments in her classroom. This camera fits in her purse and takes great pictures. She seems to be very happy with it.", positive
"Because it is great my grandma used to use a wind up camera and it used to make a lot of noise and know it is quiet at all of our activities", positive
"This camera is wonderful. I am enjoying my camera very much. It takes really good pictures and videos. Great buy", positive
"I would start by saying this is a very good \"cheap\" camera. It is ideal for novice users, or anyone who wants good vacation shots and is not a snob about cameras. It takes very high quality pictures and 720P HD video and is very easy and intuitive. It has nice big screen to look at picture and video you have taken and it interface with your pad or PC via USB or by SD card. The camera requires, but does not come with an SD card. I bought the 64gb card and it is my understanding this is the maximum this camera can use. It has 5x zoom which is not awesome, but adequate for the casual user.  Underwater housings are also available for this camera. For the price, \(\$69.00 using Amazon Prime\) you cannot do better. This is vastly superior to my previous powershot.  It is an excellent bang for your buck and I love the size and quality for average use.", positive
"One of the best deals I got for this Thanksgiving\! The camera is easy to use. And I cannot trust Cannon more on its great color.", positive
"I got this for my Granddaughter because she loved to use mine every time she came here.  It is a great point and shoot.  Takes super pictures and is very easy to use\!\!", positive
"I asked for this as a Christmas gift and am SO happy I did.  I am a professional photographer and wanted something small to put in my pocket and take to the park with my kids...my DSLR is big and bulky.  I fiddled with the camera for a while and was thinking it might be okay, but I would likely not use it much.  Then I turned off the flash and turned on the vibration control.  Now I LOVE it\!  It takes great pictures, even indoors without a flash.  I am quite impressed and would highly recommend this camera.", positive
"Its small but gets the job done was surprized it had panaramic on it ive always like that feature gave it as christmas gift reciever was happy used it same day but it doesnt come with a case,sd card . Takes good pictures", positive

"If you are not professional like me but love take good pictures, that\'s the camera. Amazing\!\!\! For the price was the best deal ever. Se voc\ê n\ão \é processional, mas ama tirar \ótimas fotos, essa \é a c\âmera. Incr\ível\!\!\! Pelo pre\ço, foi um \ótimo neg\ócio. Vale a pena.", positive
"This was a Christmas gift and loved the moment it was opened.  I think it has been put down only long enough to recharge the battery.", positive

"I had ordered everything to make a nice gift. The only thing that came was the camera. It was to be gift wrapped as is all the rest of my order. The camera was shrink wrapped to a piece of cardboard and my note was glued to the outside of the shipping box. I went out and bought a Scan Disc memory card and had a charged battery to fit. My wife was trying to learn how to use her new camera tonight. She asked about the caring case and extra memory card and battery and charger and I told her they had not arrived. I have been in contact wit 2 reps. of Amazon . com and they assured me that I would have the rest of my order the 23 and 24th. I would only hope that they are wrapped like a gift and my card put inside the box. Please make this a good gift as she will be going on a family trip right after Christmas day.  Thanks for the help Romone, I known you are doing your best to please this old man. Merry Christmas.  Gary Maurer", positive

"I do a lot of photography, own a lot of cameras including pricey ones by NIKON \(7100\) and CANON \(G10\)  and LUMIX \(LX7\) and SAMSUNG \(GALAXY\). I also own and use a lot two CANON POWERSHOT A4000 IS, for which I paid just over \$100 each. Has the \"DIGIC 4\" chip used in many of their best DSLR cameras, a 3\" display, 8X optical and 8X digital zoom. The review is about the A2500, the little brother to the 4000. It also has the DIGIC 4 chip \(that\'s something important, one smart brain in this box\). It has a 28mm wide angle as does the A4000. It has only a 5X optical, 5X digital zoom. The \"IS\" stands for Intelligent systems, and while BOTH cameras take awesome pictures and represent for normal folks super deals that will keep up with the far more expensive cameras \(like those listed above\) for normal use, the A4000 IS deals with tricky lighting and the outer margins of early morning, late evening, backlit scenes, and so on, better than the A2500. BOTH are super deals. My tired eyes appreciate that larger display on the somewhat more expensive A4000 IS. I also like to \"crop tight\" meaning I really zoom in. That again is a slight advantage to the A4000 IS. If photography isn\'t a passion, either will do a great job. If you spend a few \$\$\$ more the A4000 will give you that difference back over the years in quality shots under tougher situations.", positive
"very good product fulfilled with my expectations I had with it, I look forward to doing future business with you, thank you very much ....", positive
"I brought this camera for my wife who has trouble with camera settings. She loves how simplistic and easy it is to use the camera. Separate buttons for picture taking and video eliminates mistakes, and the camera takes very good pictures espcially for its price. She likes how light weight the camera is and also the charging case for the battery that doesn\'t have a cumbersome cord.", positive
"I purchased this camera on the recommendation of a friend who has an earlier model and is a professional photographer. It is exactly what I wanted and needed. I absolutely love it for its great, clear pictures and ease of use. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a light\-weight, simple camera. I purchased a Canon because of the great results from previous Canons that I have owned. My last Canon wasn\'t working properly and I was unable to get replacement parts to due to its age, so this was a great replacement product.", positive

"Does what it said it would, good value for the money.Fairly sturdy\- already been dropped a couple of times.Good battery life. Good quality of the pictures, but I\'m not an expert, there.Took me a while to find the \" Delete all pictures\" in the menu options. Wish the choice was made easier wirth the trash can icon on the front.", positive

"We bought this for our 12 year old to have at Christmas as her first camera.  It is really easy to use and has been a great camera and was a great price.  Nothing fancy, which is exactly what we wanted.", positive
"It is easy to use. Point and shoot. The pictures are good, even though we are unskilled. Recommend buying backup batteries. The 600mAh battery doesn\'t last a full day of hard use.I was surprised that the case was as efficient as it was. I expected a 3\/4 opening to be a challenge but it was the perfect size to hold the camera in place when unzipped. Attach the carabiner to your belt loop. Slip the camera in the case with the wrist strap outside the case. Zip the case closed. Now the wrist strap can be used when removing the camera. It\'s reassuring to have the strap first.", positive
"Bought these for my two sisters....good price and they are happy with the product.  One sister bought the same one for a friend that never had a digital camera before and he is working it with no problem....didn\'t know it came with no SD card though \!", positive

"Seeing so many reviews with low ratings because people aren\'t reviewing properly. Review the actual product, when you complain about amazon or if it didn\'t come with a case or sd  card, that doesn\'t educate a buyer on the camera\'s performance. I see an overall star rating, and I\'m sometimes pushed away from a product because people are upset about things included in a sale. I want to know if the camera takes good pictures or how long the battery will last and people are rating it a 1,2,3 star because they are upset over accessory details and never even rate the actual camera. If you not happy with a purchase, send it  back, don\'t rate the camera a 1 star without even mentioning it, such as this review now has little merit on the camera.", positive
"We like this and the Elf version so much we have now bought another one for our second child. Great, easy to use camera that comes in a fun color and won\'t disappoint a 5\-10 year old new camera user who also wants to take videos...but will also please the adult user who just wants a no\-fuss compact digital camera with HD Video capability to tuck into a purse, pocket or bag for ease of use over a larger DSLR camera outfit. Bonous on our order of this product this time \= it came with a free SD Card\! Pairing it up with a CoreLogic slim case and it\'s a great Santa Gift for our child\!", positive

"I love Canon.  I had an A2300, and needed to replace it, so I went with a model as similar as possible.  This model has built\-in  instructions, so you don\'t HAVE to have a manual.  The photos are great for my applications.  I didn\'t realize it came WITHOUT a memory card \(gee, I thought I was getting a GREAT price\) so I was delayed in getting started with it.  Overall, though, I would highly recommend this camera.", positive
"Like many other owners of this camera, I downloaded the manual onto my iPad2 home screen rather than print the 100\-plus pages. There are many functions to discover and implement\-\-including a self\-timer, and the iPad makes it convenient to learn the functions, even when I am waiting at the doctor\'s office. That being said, I still have not learned all the functions because the numerous icons therein are like learning a foreign language. But I AM learning them little by little.Because I am a beginner with digital cameras, I am using the most\-basic functions first, such as using auto\-focus pretty nearly exclusively to help me become familiar with the camera. So far so good, and I truly enjoy using the camera and printing the photos, which have all come out to my satisfaction. Getting back to the manual\:  This 100\-plus page manual is packed with information making this camera surprisingly high\-tech for such a compact camera. Without the manual to describe and explain all the functions, I doubt that I would enjoy this camera as much as I do. And the camera price is extremely reasonable, as is that of the case that protects it well.As for having to buy a memory card, as one reviewer pointed out, when we used to buy NEW film cameras we did not expect to receive a free roll of film with it.USB cable not included\! either\! but check the online manual and you may find it listed under \"Optional Accessories.\"", positive

"I got this to replace a Sony point and shoot camera that started taking somewhat lousy photographs through no fault of my own. It\'s great for events where a more professional camera would be a hassle to carry, but a cell phone camera would be lacking. I used it at a meet and greet after a concert, and it took excellent photos of the artist and me. I used it recently to snap some photos of Christmas lights, and I was pleased at the quality. It\'s a great budget camera, with a small zoom, but it takes great photos.FYI, some people complained because it doesn\'t contain a USB transfer cable, it\'s easier to just take the SD card out and put it directly in your computer to transfer photos.", positive
"I decided to buy this camera for the great\'s reviews and comments from other customers. I though that it was a great opportunity to get my first camera \(as the offer said that you would get some items free with the purchased of some camera listed\), and really it was. Finally I got the camera which meets all my expectations. But I though that memory card and the Amazon basics compact camera case will be sent with my purchase, since the offer said that those items came free with my purchase \(Cannon Powershot A2500\). I have a chat with a Customer representative \(Manisha\) and now they are going to send me the items that I did not received previously. Thanks Amazon for your understanding.

It is so small and cute, light weight and takes out such clean and crisp pictures and it is easy to use. It is not complicated like some other digital cameras. All the steps are one after the other at the touch of your thumb. This is not a professional camera but can be used for those who like to travel whether home or abroad or just to have fun pics. I love it and would recommend it to you.", positive
"My answer to this is somewhat paradoxical in that once you have figured out all of the complexities of the menu functions and how to set it up...it becomes one of the best quality and easily operated digital cameras of its kind. Simply as advice to the prospective buyer I would hardily advise you to purchase its case and a good high quality \(\#10\) Flash Memory Card with this camera. Even though it functions extremely well and is quite competitive with higher priced cameras it is small and delicate in nature. sms", positive

"I love the Canon series of digital cameras. This is the fourth one of the several that I have purchased over several years, because I have purchased them as presents for my grown kids. This one has 16 megapixels, and it takes great photos of things that are moving. I took a photo that included the TV in the shot, and the close up showed the picture on the screen of the TV perfectly.  I have a slight tremor in my hands, and I can take good pictures using this camera despite this. I have also been known to accidentally drop my camera, even though I try to use a lanyard around my neck to secure it. So far, even with dropping it, my older Canon camera hasn\'t needed to be repaired.", positive

However, I found the camera very easy to use, and I LOVE IT\!My main reason for purchasing this camera over others is for the rechargeable battery.

I like that it fits in the palm of your hand, the battery lasts and lasts, the videos I took were crisp and sharp, and the price was the best deal in town. It is perfect for any occasion, and the accessory transfer cable not only acts as a charger, but allows me to transfer my pictures to my photo program without having to open the camera and remove the SD card. Not fancy, but practical for the price.", positive

"This is my 6th point and shoot \(P\&S\) camera in 9 years, ranging in price from \$200\-\$300. I have had 1 Bell \& Howell, 3 Nikons and this is my 2nd Canon P\&S camera. The last 2 P\&S cameras I had I literally wore out by taking so many pictures. I bought this as a second camera for my husband \(who doesn\'t usually take pictures\) to use when he goes hunting with my son. I chose a Canon because I have a Canon DSLR and love it. I also wanted an inexpensive camera, because I thought it would sit on the shelf for most of the year. Of course it did not come with a memory card, as I have yet to buy any camera that does.To test this camera, after shooting indoors for a bit, I took it to the park. Luckily, what started out as a sunny day turned cloudy, allowing me to test the camera in different lighting. This is a typical low priced P\&S camera.  Like all P\&S cameras, this one performs best in bright, outdoor lighting. However, the ease of use and quality of pictures for the small price tag makes this a good buy. This is one of the better P\&S cameras I have had.Although no instruction manual was in the box \(other than the very basics\), it was easy to figure out how to manually set this camera, which is a must for me. I liked the fact that it has a PROGRAM setting, which allows me to set a program manually. Even if I switch to another setting, it saves my manual settings, allowing me to switch back and forth between settings. That was great when I tested it, because the lighting went from sunny to cloudy and back again. I could easily switch from AUTO to LANDSCAPE to PROGRAM \(my manually programmed settings\) and back, depending on lighting and activity, all while holding my 6 month old. The pictures I took while holding my baby \(who was trying to grab the camera\) of my 4 other children who were riding a moving train turned out surprisingly good. I also manually adjusted the ISO to 1600 and took some shots while holding my squirming baby, and the pictures were not as noisy as I thought they would be.This is a great camera for the price. I would definitely recommend it for anyone, especially those who are ready to do some manual adjustments to get better pictures, but not ready to spend a lot of money. I am glad I bought this camera, and I am happy because I think I will actually use it more than I originally thought\!", positive
"I am a fan of Canon Camera\'s, and have an older version of the Canon Rebel. However although I really bought this camera for my wife, I do enjoy taking it with me when I am out myself. It is easy to slip into the pocket, and quick to get ready to take a photo. The quality of the photos is brilliant. The colors are so vivid, and real. The Auto\-focus is perhaps the best that I have seen is a compact digital camera. The screen shows what points the camera is focusing on, so you know instantly your subject is in focus \- of it you need to re\-frame your image.Most importantly the actual photo taking is quick. Some digital cameras will blur when the subject moves at the point the photo is taking, because of the delay in processing the photo onto your memory card. I\'ve not had any such problems with this camera.I would recommend this camera to serious photographers who, like me just like to carry a camera everywhere they go. Or as a 1st camera for someone new to digital photography.", positive
"We love our canon PowerShot A2500 Digital Camera.  It is very compact, light, but works like the big camera\'s.  It takes great pictures, the zoom feature is fantastic and photo\'s can be easily downloaded to your computer.  For the value, this is an exceptional camera.", positive

"i bought the powershot for a class reunion weekend and it excelled\! it gave me several hundred of the nicest photos i\'ve ever taken and i cant wait to take it out and take some more photos\! a couple videos too that also was very easy to do. what i really like about the powershot is you can SEE the photos right as you take it,  so say one was blurry due to new user error. it shows you the photo and you can say right away \" nope try again\"  that was VERY handy along with showing people thier photos in case they wanted a try \#2. same with erasing very easy.before i bought this i knew nothing about Digital cameras, the last one i had was a film camera ten years ago. so this was my first digital camera purchase, and what a brilliant purchase it was, the amazon reviews and basic instructions were enough to know what i need and how use it, you must have a photo memory card \( not sent with the camera so when it says do you want the package YES you do\!\)  and you must charge the battery beforehand and check it, if you are away from home make sure you take the battery charger and if you\'ve used it alot check the battery i forgot to do that and the third night i couldnt take photos. it warned me.. i just thought.. nah.. it will be okay. \( nope but once it charged it was fine\) but not only was it easy for me to take clear wonderful photos of my reunion weekend, it was easy for my friends taking photos with it too to just use it as well.  the automatic sensing flash was nice too. the digital uploads of the photos \( with separate purchase of the cable\) also could not have been easier. i also liked the little bag that came with the package. it had a nice belt clip. also if i didnt have a belt loop it was very easy to tuck in my pocket and not have to schlump a large camera and case along. it was dropped by accident on a hardwood floor and kept on going with no problems.  everybody went oh no\! and i was like nope\! its good\! say cheese\!the price couldnt have been nicer also.. very pleased with my new Canon Powershot\!", positive

After serious thinking and seeing reviews, I decided to go with the Cannon PowerShot. I gambled with the Bad reviews, and it payed off. A great buy, and awesome camera. I have NO complaints with this camera. I figure that the bad reviews on this were either people who don\'t like Canon, or they received a camera that was wonky directly from the factory. No complaints with this camera. My dad loves it, it takes awesome pictures. Definitely a good buy.", positive

"As a long time Canon compact camera user my favorite new features on the A2500 are...The Canon PowerShot A2500 does not just stop at taking images but is rather adept at handling videos as well. It is capable of producing 720p HD files at the touch of a button. One of the thoughtful things about this camera is the inclusion of the movie button. You do not have to fidget about with all sorts of controls in order to get the video going. Rather you go back to that simple button and the rest is history.Another nice feature is that this product is newly minted with an ECO mode which is designed to reduce the power consumption on your camera.The Canon brand has made cameras its specialty and the Canon PowerShot A2500 holds true to type. This model brings out all the features that you would expect of a camera of its class but has the added advantage of making it easier for the consumer to access those features. In other words you get the best of both worlds with a great camera and easy usage.Verdict\:There are no major surprises with the Canon PowerShot A2500. It is a great camera that does what it says on the box.If you are looking for the next model up check out the Canon SD330 as it has another level of features and quality.http\:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00B5HE3UU\/ref\=as\_li\_ss\_tl\?ie\=UTF8\&camp\=1789\&creative\=390957\&creativeASIN\=B00B5HE3UU\&linkCode\=as2\&tag\=stupisms\-20", positive

"My good ol\' Elph 7mp finally faded after years of hard use.  I miss its steel case and classy style, but this replacement is working out fine.  I fail to understand complaints \-\- this is a nifty little vade mecum \(that\'s, like, Latin, like, y\'know\) that does what it is designed to do and as advertised.  For heavy lifting I have my Canon Rebel \(yes, I\'m a complete amateur\).Last year I bought the Nikon J1 as a pocket camera.  It broke.  Nikon did not honor its own written warranty, but in compensation I enjoy telling people why it\'s held together with rubber bands.  That is my first and last Nikon.  Unless Canon has changed in the home office, they honor their warranties.", positive
"This was a gift for my Mother and, so far, it is working out great.  We both hate that you can\'t see the screen on cameras when your using them in the bright sun and, even if it is \"old school\" thinking, I still love to use a view finder while taking pictures.", positive

"Two reasons I picked this camera. It has a view finder because you can\'t always see the screen in the bright outdoors. Second, the batteries. I don\'t have to carry a battery charger when I travel. If my batteries run down when I am on the go, I can always find AAs. I use rechargeable AAs and have had no issues mentioned in previous reviews. I do use the newest kind, which may hold the charge better. Takes great photos. It\'s a great pocket camera when I don\'t want to take my big Canon.", positive

"I love this camera.  \"Science News\" ran an article proving that it\'s possible for a human being to actually fall in love with an inanimate object.  Well, I\'m in love\!  I bought an earlier version of this camera \(A1200\) several years ago.  Though I have a DSLR system including two Canon cameras \(20D and 10D\) and 17\-40L, 200L, 70\-200L top notch lenses, I always grab my little Canon A1200 when I go anywhere.  This little jewel has a real, bright, \"tunnel\" viewfinder as well as a large \(2.7\"\), brilliant LCD.  This is not to mention a five power Canon lens\!  Frankly, I see this camera as the little brother of the pro Canon G series \-\- I have the G10 model and the A1400 almost matches it when its photos are enlarged to 8\" X 10\".  Don\'t underestimate the capabilities of the A1400\'s 1\/2.3 sensor\!  Take a portrait of a lovely young girl and see every eyelash, every hair, every gleam in her eyes.", positive
"I was on a tight budget\- my camera before this one just stopped working one day after the warranty ended.Does simple shots with ease. Lack of too many controls forces you to be more creative.", positive
"I carry and shoot a Nikon D800 but I have been looking for a long time for a very compact point and shoot that I can stick in my pocket for those occasional shots when my big camera may not be accessible.  This is perfect.  Takes AA batteries and has a viewfinder which is getting almost impossible to find on a point and shoot.  I don\'t do well taking pics using the lcd display\!", positive
"I am not a professional picture taker by any means.  I do, however\; enjoy having pictures from every occasion.  This is a small camera that takes good pictures.  The only drawback for me is it didn\'t come with any instructions\!  I had to ask a younger person how to operate some of the functions on the camera.  I am happy with the pictures.", positive

"I just returned another camera from another company, which required about an hour of reading just to get it to work, and after a month of trying, it never did work right. Too many damn bells \& whistles. The reviews on this Canon model looked promising, and I was able to start taking pictures with it in about 5 minutes right out of the box. \(Of course I\'m a guy, I mess with stuff first \& then read the directions\) Still, with just a few minutes of reading, the basic functions got figured out \& I ran all around the house \& yard taking test photos everywhere. Not a bad shot in the batch. Then I found out quite accidently that it was already compatible with my Mac\'s I\-Photo program. Just plugged it in \& the photos downloaded, ready for me to process. This one\'s a keeper.", positive

"The view finder is the icing on the cake of this little gem. Compact, regular AA cells and stick in your pocket, who could ask for more. It will find a place in my wife\'s purse. Seems like a better option than  using a smart phone. Pictures are for cameras not telephones.", positive
"I am not a tech savvy person, therefore this meets my needs.  I like the view finder as well as the little screen.", positive
"I love this camera\! It\'s got plenty of perks for a low price, starting with plenty of great shooting modes...or just leave it on auto and enjoy the simplicity of great pics with zero effort. The 720p video was a pleasant surprise as well, I find myself using it much more than I thought I would, it makes videos a breeze to shoot. Battery life with rechargeable batteries is great, with over 250 pics taken before a recharge was needed and being able to use regular alkaline AA\'s is a nice thing to have when on vacation.I love the size as well, small enough to slip into a pocket, but designed as such as to allow easy one handed use, something I think is essential when using a camera. All told, for the low price, this is a no brainer if your looking for ease of use, great pics, and good video with Canon\'s great quality added.", positive

"You simply can\'t find a digital camera with this price performance combination that happens to have a traditional view finder. I love this camera and use the lithium batteries on it. It takes great pictures and is a very capable camera.", positive
"The one thing that I really like about this camera is that has a view finder. This is not often found on this type of camera any more.Secondly, I like that it uses standard AA batteries as I use it on the Job and don\'t have time for recharging\! Also, by not using the LCD screen while taking pictures, it saves a lot of battery life.", positive
"We are very pleased with the functionality and ease of use of this camera. The photographs are very good quality. What we really like and the reason for the purchase was the viewfinder \(eyepiece\) this camera has. All too often, the visual display on the camera back is \"washed out\" and difficult to see in strong sunlight. The viewfinder allows the subject to be captured perfectly under all light conditions. No complaints about this camera\; also a very reasonable price, and we like the idea that it utilizes easy to obtain AA batteries, both alkaline and rechargeable.", positive
"Bought this for my 12 year old grandson. Just developing an interest in photography.  Thought this would be a good start.", positive
"I bought this camera for my mother, because I borrowed her camera when I went on a trip. When her camera returned back home the shutter did not open anymore. Ooops\! So, being the favorite and only son, I shopped and bought her this camera. This camera is a huge step up from the camera she had and she absolutely loves it. She says this was to be her Christmas, but I told her it is only a replacement for the camera I borrowed and returned useless. I\'m glad I was able to borrow mom\'s old camera so I could replace the old with a new, awesome, updated camera\!", positive
"This is not the very latest, but it is one of the few small cameras you can now buy which have an optical viewfinder, which I think very important outdoors when it is hard to see the LCD.  I also chose it because it uses two AA batteries, so that my grandchild would not find it useless if she had forgotten to charge it.  Of course, she can use rechargeable AA.", positive

"Hi,I have my main Canon SX260 camera \& this little one is a backup. Sometimes, when you travel near or far, it\'s nice to know you have a very adequate backup when your main camera might have an accident\? My SX260 is very nice \(has a sturdy metal case, full hd, 20x zoom, fantastic\!\)  BUT the A1400 has a CCD sensor while my SX260 uses the CMOS \(the CCD type sensor gives you  a better quality picture\). Also, the A1400 has a larger 16.1 Megapixel effective image size but the SX260 only has 12.1 megapixels \(interesting\?\). Even the newer SX280 model keeps those same CMOS \& 12.1 megapixel sensors\?I really love the view finder on the A1400 \(on so many occasions, that sun is directly overhead\) and unless you have one of those \"TILT LCDs\", it drives me crazy to clearly see what I\'m trying to film\? And of course, the double AA battery power \(for colder areas, you can buy some extra lithium to prevent any freeze\-up\) is fantastic. You can get double AAs anywhere, plus most of us have the Eneloop rechargeables\?This camera is small \& lite and will fit in most pockets, especially anything like cargo shorts. The camera gives great still pics \& the HD is fine but of course my SX260 is way better in anything with video. Yet, I know my little backup camera will provide me with nice pics \& HD vids wherever I am, if my main camera ever stops working properly\! Finally, around \(\$60.\) for a nice, new Canon camera, this was a real easy choice for me\?\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-TIPS\:\?01 \- I use a leftover \(rock the frogskins, pacific blue \/ Oakley nylon sunglass bag\/pouch, looks really good\!\) to cover\/protect the camera\/lens. Of course, these bags are the micro type \& nice if you ever have to wipe some speck of dust\/dirt off your lense. For me, the nylon pouch is fine for this small backup and they sell them at any mall.02 \- 2 extra slim case, Sandisk 32gb SDHC cards with the camera, easily fit in this bag.03 \- Also, Amazon sells these cool \"PowerPax Storacell Slim Line\" AA battery caddies \& they work great.  Their orange color will make a nice contrast and they have many other colors available\?04 \- Another nice thing about this camera is that the insides, actually have markings for the proper way to face your memory card \& batteries. My SX260 doesn\'t, so if I haven\'t used it for awhile \(markings would be helpful\?\). The A1400 can also use the higher capacity SDXC, eXtra capacity memory card. For me, this newer SDXC card is great, 64 or 128GB, you can movie forever. Yet, my old VISTA system isn\'t fond of it, I have to use one of those USB computer cords to download \(AMAZON, sells an A1400 cord for around \$6.00\). It immediately loads the \(JPEC \& MOV\), no problem. Then, I\'ll double\-click the \"MOV\" and Apples Quicktime will convert, I\'ll login to Utube where the movie file is converted to an \"MP4\" format, so easier to manage\!05 \- Lastly, sometimes you might be taking pics around water \(a boat ride under the Golden Gate or the surf around some rocky beach \- lots of spray\), nevermind it might be one of those drizzle days\? If your just taking tourist or web shots, why risk getting moisture on the lens or in\-between the zoom mechanism of your best camera, use the A1400 \(16.1 megapixels\) ain\'t bad and I\'m thinking of buying another \(just for this reason alone\?\).\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-SX280\:1080p\/60p Full HD videoWith the camera\'s advanced DIGIC 6 Image Processor enabling \"MP4\" format recording, the PowerShot SX280 HS lets you shoot video at a selectable frame rate of 60 fps or 30 fps. 1080p\/60p Full HD video is extraordinarily smooth and rich in playback, ensuring that your important memories and creative film clips look their absolute best. Video recorded at 30 fps has also been improved through the combination of the DIGIC 6 Image Processor and Fine Movie Detail Processing, with reduced noise and high resolution.\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-", positive

"I was looking for a camera that had the following criteria\:Universal AA or AAA batteries \(not proprietary Li\-ion or other technologies\), HD Video recordingLightweight, \"easy to use\" and not that many buttons, and inexpensiveThis camera meets my criteria.\(1\) Here\'s a further explanation of the battery issue\:The problem with Li\-ion batteries is that once a manufacture changes the battery pack and no longer makes the battery it becomes hard to find. Li\-ion batteries have a shelf life of about 2 years \(from the data of manufacture\) \& if they haven\'t been charged in that time frame, they will not last very long. Once they are fully discharged they may not \"recover\". You could end up buying a new battery pack and only getting at best 4\-6 shots before needing a recharge.The Canon A1400 uses 2 AA batteries. My preference is two use Sanyo \(now Panasonic\) Eneloop NiMH \(Nickel Metal Hydride\) Rechargeable batteries. I have over 5 years of experience using these throughout the household. They can be recharged from 1500 to 1800 times \(depends on the series\) and can hold up to 90\% of their charge for up to a year. I carry two in the camera and two as spares in a compact camera case \(Case Logic DBC\-302 purchased here on Amazon as an \"add\-on\" purchase and therefore discounted\).With Alkaline batteries you can take up to 150 \(screen on\), 200 \(ECO mode\), or 500 \(screen off\) still shots \(less if you use flash and\/or zoom a\-lot or playback \(review\) shots. With NiMH rechargeable, the number of shots increase to 500 \(screen on\), 600 \(ECO mode\) or up to 1100 \(screen off\). In Screen off mode, you use the built\-in viewfinder \- which is becoming increasingly difficult to find in an \"entry\-level\" camera.\(2\) You can quickly change the default picture size from 16MP \(default\) to 8MP, 2MP, 0.3MP \(VGA\) or Widescreen using the \"Func.\/Set\" button on the back of the camera.\(3\) The camera includes digital \(not optical\) image stabilization \(IS\) which is better than nothing. For still images without a tripod or slow moving scenes, it works fairly well. For fast action scenes, the camera takes 3 shots and then chooses the best one to use. Again for the price you pay it would be hard to find a point and shoot camera that uses optical image stabilization.\(4\) You can record \(make\) movies in 720p resolution. This was another reason that I wanted this camera. I have a larger DSLR \(Olympus E\-620\) and 5 lenses to go with it that is great for shooting a lot of different kinds of pictures \(close\-up, far away or fast action\), but it does not have the ability to record \(make\) a movie. So this camera fills a void and does so at a nice price point. It\'s a good daily or spur of the moment camera.\(5\) I wish it came with a printed manual, a USB cable and at least a 1 or 2 GB SD card but it came with none of these items. It does come with a wrist strap and a pair of alkaline batteries. Fortunately, I was able to download the manual and use a 2 GB \(class 4\) \& 16 GB \(class 10\) SD card that I had laying around at home. It works well with either density or speed.\(6\) Although it does not come with software, you can download some free software at the Canon website that allows you to import pictures from the camera with a USB cable or through a USB card reader to\:  Manage\/Print the images, and Edit the pictures as follows\:\(a\) Correct Red\-eye,\(b\) Auto Correct,\(c\) Adjust color and Brightness,\(d\) Increase Sharpness,\(e\) Crop Image,\(f\) Insert Text,\(g\) Stitch photos \(to create a panoramic photo\),\(h\) Edit Movies, and\(i\) Extract Multiple images from Movie \(this feature alone makes the \"free\" software worthy enough of a download\/install.The software works on Windows \(from 95 to 8.1\), Mac OS 8 to OS X 10.9, and Linux \(something for everyone\).To get the software, go to the Canon website, click on Support, pick a region of the world and then a country, then \"Consumer \& Home office\", then \"Powershot cameras\", then \"Powershot A series\", and finally scroll down \& select the \"Powershot A1400\" camera. Once there, you\'ll be able to download the user manuals, guides and\/or brochures as well as the software.On balance this is a great entry level camera with a lot of useful bells and whistles \(features\). I recommend that you download one or both of the searchable PDF manuals. It takes decent pictures \& easily slips into your pocket \(but I prefer to use a compact camera case more for protection than anything else\). It comes with a wrist strap, a pair of alkaline AA batteries and a 1 year warranty. Its a camera for all ages.Like anything, the more you use the camera in different settings \& modes the better you get at using it. The \"auto\" mode is nice when there is plenty of light, it\'s also a great learning tool as you get to see what the camera chose on your behalf. You can also turn off the digital zoom and rely only on the 5x optical zoom.If you find that you need more flash \"light\" \(something that extends the flash range up to 30 feet\), look at the Canon HF\-DC1 that sells for around \$52 here on Amazon. It\'s triggered by the built\-in flash \(recall that light travels pretty fast\) and can come in handy.As with every camera product, you can spend more money and get something better but at every price point you can make that decision. For me the last criteria is that the camera was inexpensive and this camera also meets that criteria. Good luck with your search \& or purchase.", positive

"My old small camera has a view finder, I have been looking for a new camera with a higher MP, but could not find one with the view finder feature, until Canon came out with this model.  View finders are great, especially when in high sun light.  I am able to focus on the photo to be taken without the display being washed out due to sunlight.", positive
"Outstanding value. It replaces an excellent older Power Shot A530 with more capacity \& features.  It is virtually impossible to find a small camera in this category with both a visual view finder and a good screen together.  A GREAT SMALL CAMERA\!  Thanks Canon for making this type of camera again. Our A530 has traveled across the globe operating flawlessly. I assume the A1400 will function flawlessly for years too\!", positive
"Not only is this camera easy to use, it is smaller than the previous A1200 model that it replaced.  It fits in the A1200 case. The A1200 was a tight fit in this case, and it fell out of the case and got damaged.", positive
"Photos and exposure settings on the Canon A1400 are superior to smartphones.  Having the optical view finder allows for more steady shots\; since, my head does not shake as much as my extended arms.  This 16 megapixel image quality is equal to my 5 year old \$320 Canon A650 with 12 MP, which had received 1st place prizes in amateur photo contests.  My image quality comparisons at ASA 100 were made using a tripod with both cameras.  Also, how can one beat using light weight 9X\-life lithium AA batteries that last for hundreds of photos and image reviews\?  Furthermore, when comparing the A1400 to the smartphone, there is a flash which reaches 10 feet or more.  So you should buy one of these before Canon pulls more models from the market.  I recommended that friend buy this camera one year ago, and I wish I had bought mine then too.", positive

"I got this one to replace my old Nikon that got broke during a trip to Germany.  At first the Camera felt cheap but it grew on me. The more I use this camera, the more I liked it.  Set up was extremely easy and straight forward. Now sure there is a better cameras out there but not at this price range in my honest opinion.  Yes, I don\'t use it but Eye\-Fi is supported. http\:\/\/support.eye.fi\/cameras\/canon\/powershot\_a1400I was going to give it one less star for not coming with a USB cable or any Cables for that matter.  But it made up for this because its mini USB input is none\-proprietary, yes that\'s right standard.  One of the cables for my USB 2.0 scan disk card reader worked Perfectly.  Then to top it off, the Camera was quickly recognized by my DIY\-er computer with Windows 8 and my wife\'s HP Windows 7 Lap Top. I like the view finder. Improvements\? 6 or 7x zoom and yes cables but shortcomings\/cons are very minimal.", positive
"good price and love the viewfinder so I can see to take pictures no matter where the sun is.  good camera", positive

The eco\-battery saver setting is great got about 25 min HD video and over \(80\) 16 meg pictures from one charge. Love the AA batteries I use rechargeables, cheap to buy and can get AA batteries anywhere if needed on a trip. The pictures and video are very good.Great Buy\!", positive
"This was a great camera for me.  I am digitally challenged, and still had no problem figuring out how to use it.  It takes a great photo.  It\'s a little slow, but not enough to make me regret my purchase.  I was VERY happy with the person who wrote the review, about be sure to take the few extra steps needed to get the memory card\!  I almost missed that, much appreciated.", positive
"I bought this camera for my wife because our other camera is a larger SLR type camera.This camera is the perfect size for carrying in a pocket or purse.As other people have said, the picture and video quality is absolutely excellent as it captures full, vibrant colors.I don\'t see how anybody could regret buying this camera.", positive
"2 years ago my daughter broke my wife\'s digital camera screen which made it unusable since it didnt have a viewfinder...and its taken me forever to find a good camera with a viewfinder since almost every company has gone without one...well i got news for ya I\'m a professional photographer and this thing has really nice quality photos... this made my wife\'s Christmas the best ever. if you are an old\-school point and shoot person that likes a viewfinder...this is the one for you\! it doesn\'t have a ton of bells and whistles but it does the job very very well\!", positive
"I haven\'t used it much, but it is similar in function to my previous \(Canon\) camera.  I appreciate the viewfinder, the AA battery power \(I use rechargeables and always keep a spare set with the camera\) and the SD card.", positive
"Love my new camera. It is just what I wanted. Nothing too complicated but easy enough to download photos to my laptop and upload for my work on line. I like being able to resize the photo file if necessary too. It is comfortable to hold with one hand. I appreciated reading all the feedback on the camera before I bought it so I knew to have a memory card and batteries when it arrived.", positive
"Yes folks, it\'s just a digital camera.  You can\'t send pictures via WIFi to your computer or your smartphone, tsk tsk...also you can\'t imbed the fact that you are in the jungle at such and such lat and long with a GPS app that saps your battery.  But if you need a second or third camera and a compact one that works and you can tolerate mostly AUTO, this is a keeper.  It\'s small, looks much better than I thought it would, uses AA batteries \- I have rechargeable so but it comes with a couple of starter batteries.  For \$85, what\'s not to like.  The EVF is small, but useable, and horrors this means you can even use this little camera in sun light.  What will they think of next\?  I agree, a few cirques are true.  After flash, it\'s a bit slow to recharge. It\'s not a camera that gives you 800 ISO for low light.  But it fits very easily in a pocket or a purse, and it\'s not bizarrely over engineered like the Panasonic I just bought that\'s basically charming but useless for it\'s presumed main purpose...taking pictures, the ZS 30 at 3\+ times the price.", positive
"Uses off the shelf batteries available everywhere.  Takes good movies with the push of one button.  Viewfinder window.  Light and small.", positive
"The eyepiece is the biggest feature.  You can\'t find one anywhere else unless you pay a lot more.  Camera takes great pictures and its tough.  I slipped and fell in Sicily in September.  Camera flew out of my hand and bounced off two cement walls before it hit the ground.  Nothing worked so I thought it was toast.  I took it back to the hotel and noticed the turret was out of line.  With nothing to lose, I attempted to bend it back.  something went Pop and everything functioned perfectly.  Still running great in December.", positive
"I took it along on two vacations. It\'s small and lightweight, and so the camera fit nicely in my purse.", positive
"Not high end, but perfect for snaps on the go with no need for the extra gadgetry haul.  It fits nicely in a pocket or purse and the picture quality is actually quite acceptable for someone who likes memories, but is not into needing crystal clear quality that a \$700.00 \+ would provide \(been there, done that \- not necessary for family memories.\)", positive
"I am new to picture taking, and this little camera makes me and my pictures look good\!.  It was just the right price for a new \"camera bug\" to get started with and it has been easy to use.  The manual is huge \(I kept a downloaded copy on my computer\)  and I refer to it often and I still have alot to learn, but I believe learning on this is the way to go before spending more on a \"fancier\" camera.  If I become really really good, I may progress to something bigger and better but if I just stay with this, I know I made a good buy. It is easy to load your pictures on line and send to friends and family.", positive
"An optical viewfinder is difficult to find in any compact camera.  Although the zoom is only 5x, the camera takes beautiful pictures with superb detail.  I was able to take close ups of several small items, something I wasn\'t able to do with a digital SLR that cost nearly ten times as much as the A1400.  The A1400 is simply fun to use.  For the price Amazon is charging, you also get the great benefit of having a 16 mega pixel camera.", positive
"Has many features which make photography much easier.  Not sophisticated enough for aficionados but an very high powered and compact point and shoot camera.  I particularly like the eye level view finder.", positive
"Well made and very small to carry.  Takes clear photos and offers a very good zoom.  Uses standard batteries so that is a plus.", positive
"nice and easy to use takes really nice pictures for a lower price point I would recommend it for young or older photographers who need something simple", positive
"The only modern camera with an optical viewfinder. This is very helpful when I am out in the woods in direct sunlight. The screen is all but invisible, making my other camera useless. And it is a simple\-to\-use Canon A\-series. Great camera.", positive
"I purchased this as a gift for my son and his fianc\ée, for Christmas so I can\'t attest to how it works but they seem to love it.", positive
"When you look at the stats and capability of this camera, this is strictly a Canon DSLR T1i or T2i \- in a miniature body. Seriously. You can\'t beat this price\! I own the T1i and the T4i, and it\'s amazing to see Canon go behind the backs of all these sales and make this small bodied capable camera. Not sure how to take this but I can assure you this\; the 16MP Digic 4 processor is a great package for less than \$65.00\!\!", positive
"worth every dime,  great pics  easy to use  does go thru batteries \( carry spares\) but there AA so they are cheap  and I do take a lot of pics with it at one time , I would get it if you want an inexpensive Canon ,  when it wears out I will get another", positive
"This camera is the easiest \"point and shoot\" camera. It\'s high megapixel makes crystal clear pictures and is super small.", positive
"I couldn\'t figure out how to change the file size this camera records \-\- Canon\'s email customer service had the solution in my inbox in less than 24 hours, on a weekend. This model runs on AA batteries, available anywhere, and has an optical eye\-level finder that zooms with the lens. These are features I miss in recent digital cameras, but this one has both. The matte surface and general ergonomic layout make this camera easy to handle. Very glad I came across this one.", positive
"It meet all my needs.Only complaint that the cord for thecamera did not come with it.It does a great job.", positive
"Camera arrived before scheduled delivery, which was great since we wanted to take pics of our daughter\'s first Christmas.The only disappointment, and part of the blame lies with us, no cable or card come with the camera. Just the camera. I am sure somewhere in the product description it states it, but for the price, the camera performs above our expectations.", positive
"A easy to operate camera with a fair price, by far a great value.But thats all I want to say\!", positive
"it IS a Great camera, but whe i bough the camera it say that I will get MEMORY CARD AND AND I DIN\'T GET IT, THATS VERY DESAPOINTED.here is the advertise\:Free 8GB Memory Card with the Purchase of This CameraPurchase the Canon PowerShot A1400 and get a free Sandisk 8GB memory card when you buy from Amazon.com.", positive
"Settings like no other. And its fool proof but yet great for a more experienced person.. clear pictures plug and play setup on pc  highly recommended\!\!", positive
"Love my new camera.  It is easy for an inexperienced person to use.  Liked the viewfinder in the blazing sun.", positive
"This camera is simple to use with outstanding results. It is difficult to take a bad picture with this camera\! I would recommend to anyone desiring a practical and simple point and shoot camera.", positive
"replaced my powershot A1200 with the A1400 recently and like it so far.  really like the palm\-sized body for \"grab shots\" when using my full size DSLRs are not practical or desirable \(like last summer in an open market in Tanzania where taking pics of the people is an automatic \$1 \"transaction\" per shot.  also like the black body for being even more inconspicuous .", positive
"I would highly recommend this little camera. Picture quality is good and very easy to use. Small and compact\! Great camera for the price\!\!", positive
"This is the third Canon Power Shot I have purchased.  I purchased this one for my wife before we traveled to Europe.  Because we take many photos out of doors, the view finder is an invaluable feature.  Plus, you never need to worry about a low battery if you just carry a couple spare double A\'s you are always prepared. And the added bonus is that this little camera takes great movies \(although the sound could be better\).", positive
"First, I am so glad Canon provides optical viewfinders on these cameras. It makes shooting in sunny conditions a breeze, no squinting to see faint images on LCD screens.HD video is great. User friendly, quick to learn interface. I didn\'t read any manuals and I was using all the features within 30 minutes. The close up macro shooting came  on automatically when I got extra close to a flower \- \- \- Outstanding\! The image stabilization working fine. Its a powerhouse camera that is small, but still has a firm grip and heft. Fits in my pockets. Has a tripod bushing and a help button. This is the result of years of experience and refinements in digital camera design and I took great care in selecting this camera, and it has turned out to be a success\!My only suggestion is the 4\-way navigation ring have better tactile properties so I can feel the right position with my finger, sometimes I hit the ring and interior button in the wrong place.", positive
"Camera met my most important expectation. Runs on AA batteries. Not a fan of battery packs as they are sometimes hard to replace and require recharging.", positive
"It is a great camera with a lot of features. It uses standard AA batteries, no need to carry a charger and wait for the battery to charge. Just throw in 2 new batteries \(available anywhere\) and keep on shooting.", positive
"I purchased this camera for my husband on my first order and was so impressed with the quality of pictures and video I had to order me one.  I haven\'t used mine yet since I already have a working camera and I have been no where to take pictures.  The shipping was fast and the price was great.", positive
"Just came back from a trip to Peru.  Love the AA batteries.  Using Lithium batteries, my wife only needed to change batteries once while taking approximately 1500 pictures.  Camera is very lightweight.  It isn\'t the smallest camera available \(due to AAs\) but still easy to fit in pocket or small camera bag.The only complaints I have relate to the multi\-function button\-wheel on the back.  First, the wheel is slightly recessed and it was a bit challenging to make selections with my fingers.  My wife didn\'t have any problems.  Secondly, we often pressed the flash selection button when pulling the camera out of its case.  This caused several times where we accidentally activated the flash when not needed, then had to wait a few seconds for the recharge before we could take the next picture.Overall, a great little camera.  I also purchased the SX160IS for myself and liked it better \(it is an incredible deal for only \$50 more\), but the A1400 is a terrific choice for a small, lightweight, travel camera.", positive
"This is a great little camera if you consider the price and what it does. I could have gotten the cheaper A2500 model but I stuck with this one because of the design which has a better hand  grip and the viewfinder unlike the flat a2500 which easily slip out of one\'s hands. Also feature wise , there isn\'t much difference between the a2500 and a1400 Picture quality is good for the camera but it does struggle in low light settings. it was also quite surprisingly small and can fit in a chest pocket. video recording quality is good at 720p HD recording  with excellent audio recording and playback. it is relatively easy to setup and can just leave it on auto to do it own thing. There are so many settings to toy with ,experiment and configure to get the desired effect. All in all ,I am enjoying my new camera and hope it stay functional. Canon has made and excellent point and shoot camera I implore people to buy it if you need a portable camera.", positive
"Just got this camera and took it on a cruise.  Like all Canon cameras \(I\'ve had many\) it is easy to operate and takes great pictures.  I got this one for times when I want a small camera that fits well in my purse, and I don\'t need a big zoom.  Best of all, it has a viewfinder.  This was great when I was out in the sun and trying to frame a shot.  Also uses AA batteries, which is my preference.  All in all a nice camera that I will enjoy using.", positive
"my daughter loves this it was a Christmas present and she is always taking pictures with it really clear pictures", positive
"Its a great camera. Great quality. Its also the perfect size not too big but not too small. I would recomend it its all i wanted.", positive

"just had a new addition to family...now we can have great quality memories every step she makes...she loves the camera already", positive
"Just enough \"bells \& whistles\" for me.  Looked at quite a few reviews before I purchased this camera.Now I know I chose the right one\!\!  Great camera for the price\!\!\!", positive
"Very easy to operate.  Pictures are great.  Battery life is good. For a point and click camera it\'s perfect. I love it.", positive
"Our only camera was malfunctioning right when we needed it. We prefer a camera with a viewfinder for the many times the screen is washed out by our bright sunshine. We also needed  some basic adjustability for photos used to sell products online.There are very few basic cameras with a viewfinder. I\'ve been very happy with my previous Canon, so we ordered this one. It was a great price, more features than we need, and smaller and lighter than the previous camera.It arrived quickly. We are very happy.", positive
"Paid around \$70 for this great little camera. So far it has been awesome, great quality shots and easy to use. Got it as a Christmas present and they have been extremely pleased with it. I would recommend for someone wanting a basic, easy to use point and shoot camera.", positive
"I bought this camera just because I like taking pictures that look nice\! It takes great pictures and how can you beat that for only \$58", positive
"Gave this to my wife as a Christmas gift and she seems to really like it.  I used it and was very satisfied with the quality and ease of use.  Picture quality is just as good as a more expensive Canon that we own.", positive
"Perfect camera to send with my son out of the country.  He does not have to worry about charging batteries in Ukraine or the different voltages of electricity.  He can just throw in a new set of batteries and he is off and running.  It is also surprisingly small and fits right in his pocket.  I like the programs and how easy it is to use.  I highly recommend this camera.  I am thinking of getting one for myself.  It is better than my camera on my phone and just as portable.  Nice job Cannon.", positive
"This camera met or exceeded all my expectations.  It is compact, light, and easy to use. The fact that it uses aa batteries was an important factor for me, because they are readily available \& easily replaced. The screen is large \& bright.  Price was below \$100.", positive
"I chose this camera for two main reasons \-\- it has a viewfinder and uses AA batteries. I bought it to replace another Canon camera that was stolen.I\'m very happy with my new camera. It\'s very easy to use. I downloaded the manual from the Canon website, and learned all about it. I\'m especially pleased with the movie function. I shot a couple of great scenes with my parrot. It was very easy to use. I\'m very happy with this camera.", positive
"Exceeds the capabilities of the Olympus we\'ve had for years and is much easier to use. really a user freindly camera", positive
"Easy to use if you are not a \'techie\'.  The pictures are sharp and clear and it almost fits in a pocket.", positive
"Easy to use. Has viewfinder to use on sunny days when you can\'t see picture on the screen. Lots of features for an inexpensive camera.", positive
"easy to use, easy to download pix with a usb cable or simply pull the SD card, excellent quality pix.  Love the viewfinder, love the fact it uses AA batteries, love the zoom, love the video capability.  Took it on a trip to France, and came home with excellent pix.  THANKS for a top quality little camera.  Bought a caribiner clip camera bag that fits it perfectly, and the camera hangs from my purse.  Easy peasy....", positive
"It\'s an awesome point and shoot camera, and my wife and I love it. We weren\'t looking for something professional, we just wanted a good camera that would capture our memories well. Takes really good pictures \- especially outside. We absolutely love it\!", positive
"A view finder in bright light is a must for me. Now I can see exactly what I\'m taking a picture of. Takes great pictures\; is compact and light weight.", positive
"I have been a FILM photographer for many, many years. This Canon is the Perfect Camera to begin the Transition from FILM Cameras to All Digital. It\'s affordable, the perfect size \& very Easy to use. The Images are Superb, with or without using the Flash. This begins my journey to the transition to a  Professional 35mm DIGITAL Camera.", positive
"Used this camera on many hiking trips, dropped several times with no damage incurred, it is a solid value for the cost, light weight, easy to operate. Photo\'s are high definition, easy to make a copy on a CD\-R of your recent adventure with the date on your pictures. It makes many memories stay alive\!", positive
"I would recommend to anyone that wants quality pictures without a lot of camera set up and adjusting.I just view image on LCD and shoot and walla a great looking picture. If you don\'t have one, buy one,you\'ll  love it\!", positive
"The camera is simple to use.  I am not a photographer and I wanted a camera that was easy to use for basic pictures.  I am pleased with my purchase.  If you want just a basic digital camera, this could fit your needs.", positive
"My son is enjoying his new camera even tho the flash Memory card did not come with our order.  Thank you", positive
"I\'m not familiar with all the technicalities of digital cameras, so I\'ll leave that to the other reviewers. I needed a basic point\-and\-shoot for a service trip, and this fit the bill. I wasn\'t expecting much, given its price \(\$70\), but found that the pictures are crisp and clear, with vivid colors even prior to any editing jobs. Image stabilization was good, and I liked the battery compartment \- it\'s convenient when you don\'t have electricity, and the slight bulge on the front helps with shaky hands. The camera itself is a good size, actually\; I was expecting something a lot bigger due to the battery compartment, but it\'s petite and classy\! All in all, a worthy buy\; if your expectations don\'t greatly exceed the price, you\'ll be very pleased.", positive
"I gave my girlfriend this camera for Christmas as her Kodak broke. She wanted something simple that would take decent photos she could print, and she had no computer. I have 3 Canons myself and always pleased with them. While I was showing her how to set it up, I found it had many features my current ones didn\'t, such as 16MP photos, 5X zoom etc. So I bought a 2nd one for myself and WOW, so much power in such a little device. What impressed me most was the HD video. It will be my shirt\-pocket pal for quite awhile. The price and the free 8GB card were both bonuses. I was disappointed with the lack of instructions so went to my favorite manual printer, manualsink.com and purchased a 124 page copy. I am a frequent customer of theirs and very satisfied.", positive
"Now we or talking, this camera I really fell in love with not to heavey what I may call just right order so Thank yall for this one", positive
"Bought this for my dad on christmas, he loves it\! it has 5x zoom and the picture quality is great\!", positive
"Love this camera and in spite of no Sd memory card as claimed , it does exactly what I wanted it to do takes nice pictures.", positive
"This is an excellent camera... very user friendly and takes fabulous pictures... crystal clear... I would recommend this to anyone\!\!", positive
"We were looking for a small camera with an eye piece as well as a screen because it is often very difficult to view the subject on the screen on a sunny day.", positive
"I\'ve used PowerShot series of cameras professionally since the A550.  The A1400 is the best so far with stunning resolution,ease of operation and the eye\-friendly viewfinder. The focusing screen is not enough when the lighting is wrong. A longer optical zoom range on the next in the A series would be a big plus. I recommend it to all my students.", positive
"This camera is very easy to use.  The sight through the eye piece is much easier to use in sunlight than the screen on the back.  The instructions are extensive and easy to read and apply.", positive
"Photos are clear and crisp, very brilliant \!\!  I am very happy with the quality of picture I am getting with this camera. We hit a large bump while snapping mtn range photo and it came out beautiful \! Def recommend for easy point, zoom and shoot.", positive
"The only concern I have is it\'s durability. I use this in my job frequently and need it to hold up. Only time will tell but I hope I get at least 4\-5 years out of it.", positive
"I bought this camera for my mom to replace the very complicated high\-end digital camera I bought for her last year.  This camera is perfect for older folks, the camera is easy to hold, has large power on\/off, shuttle, video and playback buttons.  The zoom dial is also perfectly oversize for older people with less dexterity.  Also the camera uses two AA batteries which is just simple and so much easier for taking on trips.I highly recommend this for senior citizens.", positive
"I bought this as an \"intermediate\" camera \- \- in between my cell phone and 30\:1 digital zoomer. It fits in a big pocket, or in a small belt pouch \- take your choice. \(Since I was traveling in pick\-pocket areas, I put it in my pocket and kept my hand in my pocket too.\)I am VERY pleased. It comes on almost instantaneously, and it also focuses quickly and shoots fast, recovering in less than a second for the next shot.Film speed is good, defaults to 1600. Not exactly for night photography, but low\-light is no problem at all.The viewfinder \(thanks Canon\) is for me indispensable, since LED screens are so hard to see in daylight \(not to mention having to get out my reading glasses\). I wish other vendors would add the viewfinder back in, but Canon seems to be the last holdout.Another thing I REALLY like for traveling is the AA batteries. Yeah, you have to buy batteries, but you do not have to carry a charger around \(and of course forget to charge your spare battery, as we all will eventually do\). This only uses two AA\'s, and they last a LONG time, maybe 500\-1000 \(non\-flash\) photos or thereabouts.Highly recommended.", positive
"I am very happy with this camera.  I like to take a camera when I go out hiking and this is perfect.  Small enough to fit in my pocket, very easy to use, long battery life and the picture quality is very good.  So far all the pictures I\'ve taken with this camera have been great.And I like that it runs on standard batteries, I can always carry spare batteries.  It does not have an included usb cable but that is not a minus for me since I have four already.My only gripe is that the case is plastic, a metal case would have been better.", positive
"The HD recording is very nice as long as it\'s not too zoomed in. The camera is VERY Light and compact. Battery life isn\'t too glorious but then again it\'s just 2 AA batteries. The charging flash can be annoying but it\'s a FANTASTIC camera for the money", positive
"My wife really liked it.  It\'s small so she can carry it with her most of the time and it uses readily available AA batteries.", positive
"Does what I want it to do. Pure and Simple. Love that it has more than just the screen to see what you are taking for a picture.", positive
"got it as a replacement for my Kodak EasyShare Z1485 IS Digital Camera  i been using for years like fact its bare bones point an shout to go along with my Canon EOS T3i good for fast shot nice bit of sating for fast use  were you cant get the big DSLR out also can take the 32GB SD cards as will adds  to the canon hardware i have", positive
"A pocket\-able camera with a view finder made by Canon and selling for less than \$100\?Upon opening the box, I was pleasantly surprised that I could grab it from multiple angles without activating any controls. Next I was surprised to see the batteries did not make the unit uncomfortably side heavy. The flash is thankfully not a popup. The larger recessed power button and indented battery compartment cover were large enough that I didn\'t have to aim unduly with my large fingers.  The start up and lag times were better than I dared hope. The operating controls kept the same Canon theme. The news just kept getting better as I continued exploring.As for the quality of pictures and it\'s ability to shoot in low light situations\? Very good, especially in low light.", positive
"I saw one that my wife had bought for high school journalism and had to have one. It takes great pictures, sure not up to bigger cameras but not that far off either. I don\'t understand some of the critical comments such as poor pictures in low light.  I just finished  a set in a museum that didn\'t allow flash and they were fine. As regards the flash, I counted 5 seconds to recharge and take another picture. I consider that acceptable. With any camera you need to watch the battery usage. Turn down the LED display or better yet use the viewfinder and allow time for the batteries to tecover or carry extra batteries for All in all a great supplemental camera which may be all that some people will require.", positive
"I just wanted something to record hikes and so on. Homemade porn if the opportunity comes around. It will serve in either case.I\'m not Consumer Reports. Anyway, if you want to be Ansel Adams may need to drop more bucks. Or be a war photographer. If you want to do that you would better served spending way more money on a shrink.It takes fine photos. I could use less menu options. Same reason I don\'t want a smart phone. I want to take a picture. I want to make a phone call. I am not revolving my life around gadgets.", positive
"This camera gives perfect digital pictures for such a small camera.The zoom was very good for a trip to the Grand Canyon.Keep the strap around your wrist to avoid dropping camera.I recommend this camera very highly.", positive
"Nice Camera and great quality pictures. Very easy to use and figure out. Small and light weight. The thing that surprised me about the camera which i missed when i ordered it is that it uses 2 AA batteries, which totally works for me because i hate having to wait for batteries to charge. It does not have a USB connection because i guess you have to download the pictures directly from the SD Card. Not a big deal. Overall its a decent inexpensive camera that takes quality pictures and video.Not that everyone uses this option but you can shut off the lcd and use the small lens to take pictures that way too.", positive
"For a point and shoot camera, it is very light weight and easy to use.  When I set the camera to mute and no flash, it held that setting until I changed it even though I turned the camera off and on. The zoom is easy to use.  The viewing screen is a nce size.  The photos I have taken so far, have turned out great.", positive
"So far the camera  works very well.  It is simple to use which is what I was looking for. I downloaded the manual which was very helpful.  I would recommend this camera.", positive
"I was looking for a camera that I could used in a hurry. At my age I want to record vacation memories. I was not looking for a camera to take professional photos. I am very well pleased with the Canon Powershot A100. Though surprised at how small it is, its size was an asset, easily fitting into pockets and purse. The AA battery life was very good and 2 AA batteries are easy to find and carry as backup. It has a view finder as well as a digital screen, and the photos are wonderful.", positive
"This camera takes great photos, and the price can\'t be beat\! Great to take along when the \"big camera\" would be too cumbersome.", positive
"I hand these out to my technicians. It\'s so easy to use and to download the pictures to the computer\!\! I love these Powershot cameras.", positive
"I love the viewfinder\-\-I can take photos in the bright sun when others are forced to guess.  My only problem is that indoors it can take a long time for the flash to go off.  Still, I really like it and the photos are excellent.", positive
"If you are looking for a great little economical camera this is it.  Love the AA Battery feature...no charger to take along on trips. You can buy backup batteries almost anywhere.  For a AA camera it has a long battery life.  I am using rechargables I bought on Amazon. The complaint about the plastic camera body made me laugh.  My \$1200.00 Olympus Mr Bulky is all plastic so is the interior on my \$40,000.00 Pickup. So why expect more from a \$100.00 camera. The only comlaint is that the SD card is in the same compartment as the AA batteries. Not a deal breaker for me, but kind of inconvenient.  Photos are excellent, sharp bright colors.  I didn\'t buy this for the video feature however it has better sound quality than my wifes \$500.00 camcorder.  I was amazed. Love the telephoto viewfinder feature. If you are looking for an economical, take along camera that does a decent job this is it.", positive
"Being able to use the view finder and turning off the back screen saves batteries.  If you do need to change batteries this camera uses standard AAs that are available everywhere.  The 5x zoom is great and more adaptable than a phone or tablet camera.  The size of the camera is great.  Fits in a pocket with ease.", positive
"The only non\-SLR camera on the market that still has an optical viewfinder...LED screens just don\'t cut it when your shooting pictures outdoors\!", positive
"Purchased this for an elderly parent who is \"scared\" of digital cameras and must use a view finder rather than the lcd screen because of poor eye sight.  I had significant requirements which were\: \(1\) easy to operate \"point and shoot\" camera\; \(2\) view finder and \(3\) replaceable AA batteries \(so no worries if someone forgets to recharge the battery\-\-because it\'s not a rechargeable battery camera\).  \(4\) light weight \(5\) small camera. This fits the requirements perfectly.  Seriously, stick an SD card and batteries in it and start taking pics. No learning curve required.  If you want rechargeable batteries, remember they are available in size AA. It does have an lcd screen too if you want to use it instead of the view finder.  Could not be happier with this purchase.  It came super quickly too.", positive
"I was looking for a good camera for our trip to Disneyland over Christmas break.  I looked on Amazon and I found it.  Just the right size to.  Easy to carry around on our trip.", positive
"Great pic quality\!  Easy to use and I can use rechargeable AA batteries\! No need to buy expensive proprietary batteries.  Also, a rare camera to have an optical viewfinder at a low price.  I don\'t think you will get better pics from paying more \- I know, I use Canon DSLRs 50D, 30D with L lenses.Great camera, great price, get one\!", positive
"I used to have a Nikon Coolpix, I liked it but had some issues it didn\'t last long. I replaced it with this canon and haven\'t had any issues. It works well, great battery life, handy size, quality pictures, user friendly. I lost the first canon I had and this is my second one.", positive
"When you get older, those so and so view screens, no matter how large, are a pain. They wash out in sunlight and we seniors must put on our reading glasses to even view them. Finally someone came out with a lower end camera with an optical finder\! The camera is for my wife who wanted a simple to operate camera with reasonable picture quality. This was it and for only \$79, a steal in my experience. We highly recommend this for anyone wanting a compact, versatile, and dependable camera for those \"snapshots\".", positive
"very good pictures, very durable, gentle with the batteries\(simple AA last forever\), I\'m using it with rechargeable,\- very happy with it.", positive
"Shipping was efficient. Great product for such a good price. I purchased a 32g, 45mb SD Card and it works well with the camera.", positive
"I am not very techie and I can handle this camera just fine.  It makes good pictures.  It seems very sturdy.", positive
"Good camera for my husband who wants simple controls, AA batteries so we don\'t worry about trying to charge in the middle of the day and lightweight.  Also helps that it takes good pictures\!  It is getting harder and harder to find cameras that still take AA batteries, so I buy them when I can.", positive
"Excellent camera for what was needed and being able to use AA batteries instead of the ones that need to be recharged is a real plus.", positive
"Easy to use.  My daughter got one and advised me to get one too.  I need it to document my quilts.", positive
"I have always been a fan of Canon and own an XL2 and a T4i but sometimes they stay at home or in the case due to their size and set\-up requirements. Having decided to get a point and shoot I quickly decided that the A 1400 was the right choice for me. Easy to learn and use, small enough to fit in a shirt pocket, and powered by AA batteries it makes shooting photos and 720p video a breeze and now I never leave home without it.", positive
"I bought this to take to Peru, as mine had died.  I was pretty nervous taking an untested camera on an amazing adventure.  But, it worked great\!  The photos are amazing \(for a point and shoot\).  All my photos turned out great, and the battery life lasted longer than my last camera, which was also a Canon PowerShot.", positive
"This is a good little camera for the money. Lot\'s of modes to choose from and they did perform well. I reconend it for a pocket knock around or do what I did buy it for son for his first camera.", positive
"I have not had a digital camera for a number of years.  I am very pleased that I chose the PowerShot 1400.  The price is definitely right and it works great.  The manual takes a long time to download \(215 pages\), but it is worth having.", positive
"For the price, it has features of more expensive cameras. Perfect for the advanced beginner. Prefer the fact that it uses AA batteries instead of a battery pack so once you remember to pack some extra AAs, you shouldn\'t miss anything.", positive
"Having a camera with a viewfinder makes it so much easier to compose a picture in bright daylight and also makes holding the camera steady much easier than holding a camera with outstretched arms.", positive
"The viewfinder and stabilizer are wonderful. You can now see what you are taking a photo off when it is sunny out and you don\'t have to worry about camera settings. Great camera to take anywhere.", positive
"I bought four of these \(prior version\) cameras for school and one for the school auction\/dance \(auctioned off with 4 hours of my time for photo instruction, etc.\).Anyhow \- I LOVE these cameras. AA batts so I don\'t have to worry about whether the camera is charged or not. \(I have a PowerShot SX210 with two lithium batts, personally. But for school, recharging batts is no good \- the cameras might sit on the shelf for a while and lose charge and I don\'t want to buy extra \$60 batts for them.\)So...kids use them, mostly, to shoot videos. Being able to take the SCCard out of the camera and put it into a small SD Card reader is just so easy. Forget about the USB cable. Most laptops now come with SD slots in them so you can pop the card out of the camera and into your laptop \- how much easier is that\?\?I think this is an EXCELLENT \-\-\> ENTRY LEVEL \<\-\- camera for kids, particularly\; but, really, anyone who wants to start learning about photography. Yeah, it lacks a lot of bells and whistles a lot of the other P\&S cameras have, but that\'s GREAT because there is nothing to distract you from learning how to \"see\" a good photo and learn all about the \"photographer\'s eye\".I\'ve also felt that it\'s good not having too much stuff on a device because then you can really learn what you are missing and KNOW what to look for when you\'re ready to move up to the next level.I think a lot of folks \"overbuy\" in a camera, especially, and then either get frustrated with it because there just is too much to learn or, worse, just don\'t use the camera.The price is right \- the camera is more than capable of taking great photos. I plan to buy some more for the school.", positive
"This is a  very nice portable camera.  It is very nice for road trips in the car and motorcycle.  It takes great pictures.", positive
"This camera is more compact tha my other camera that was stolen. I pirchase a cheap camera for \$15.00 and was very unhappy with the pictures. Saved for this camera and WOW what a difference. I have purchased Canon cameras for 10 \+ years and have never been disappointed. Highly recommend purchasing for the ease of use for those of us that just want to take pictures.", positive
"best camera I have ever had. I love the features, the pictures are very clear and it\'s easy to use.", positive
"Easy to handle, solid but lightweight.. Compact just like all other brands but have easy to use viewfinder on those bright days. I was pleasantly surprised with this camera and I love it\! Great crisp photos. Would recommend this to everyone that likes point \& shoot cameras.", positive
"I would recommend this product still need to use it more for further evaluation at this time after my summer vacation", positive
"I bought this camera for when I don\'t want the weight of my SLR and when the weather could damage it. Great photos. Easy to use.", positive
"I bought this camera because of the described features \- regular batteries, HD movies as easy as pressing a button, the extra small eye for glare\-free steady focus.  To supplement my camera, I ordered a 16GB memory card, the recommended case, the 2\-year protection plan and after a little research, the designated USB cable\: \(which with shipping cost \$10.74\). After trying it out on a skiing trip I was pleased with the fast shooting, the long battery life, true colors and textures. Awesome camera\!", positive
"This camera is an absolute dream to use. So simple from the first time picking up. Point and shoot. All there is to it. Takes beautiful pictures. I really enjoy using it. Would defiantly buy again\!", positive
"I bought this camera for my wife, it\'s her first digital product. Couldn\'t be easier for a beginner.Takes great pictures. Preview button for pictures is a nice feature.Nice size, good price.", positive
"We bought this to replace a point and shoot that we lost in Florida while on vacation.  There are very few point and shoots with two ways to look at the subject of your photo.  This camera has that option which I really like when the sun is shinning full blast and you can\'t see the screen at the back of the camera. Now we can look through the viewfinder and do it that way.  The pictures are great and the quality is excellent.  Would highly recommend this camera.", positive
"Came with no usb cable for computer upload or any mention of it in there add, plus no software to make it all work except another web site that wants to charge you  \$4.00 to down load it to your computer. What a rip off \!\!\-\-Amazon used to be on top of things like this,Oh well looks like all things go to the dogs eventualy or corprate profits for bonuses.\-\- Wont be Fooled again.JJ Pryce", positive
"I owned a previous version of the camera and really liked it.  I wanted to get the same kind with a viewfinder.  I am so glad they still made this with a viewfinder\!  Great feature for really sunny days.  This camera is smaller than my previous version which I love.  It takes excellent pictures\!  I like it so much I bought three others for family members.", positive
