"WASTE OF MONEYWhat a crappy camera. The worse part of the camera is the audio on the movies. It\'s absolutely ridiculous that this is an issue. You\'d think it would be a simply software fix but this is crazy. The TG\-1 had the same problem and it\'s not being fixed. I guess this is what you get when you buy NON USA.The quality of the image is really not that good unless the lighting is amazing.", negetive
"There\'s a salutory lesson here about not jumping to premature conclusions. Based on my first impressions of this camera I had mentally started drafting a review based on praising the hardware, but with some criticism of the software and firmware. I even had a great tag line\: \"A camera for adventurers who want a few pictures, rather than photographers who want adventures\". That was before the snorkelling trip...For many years now if there\'s been the prospect of either snorkelling or diving on holiday I\'ve taken a Canon PowerShot S\-series or G\-series camera with its waterproof housing. I\'ve had at least three generations of that solution, which have been utterly reliable and produced some good results. However they are a bulky solution in these days of reducing baggage allowances, and somewhat slow and clumsy in operation.This year, therefore, I decided to try a different solution, and opted after some deliberation for one of the new \"ultra tough compacts\". While Canon and Panasonic both have a comparable solution, after some deliberation I went for the Olympus TG2, based on a combination of its looks and spec.This is supposedly a very tough piece of kit \- waterproof to 15m, drop\-proof to 2m, crush\-proof to 100kg and with a large operating temperature range. The downside is that this is a market where the competition is intense but based on point for point feature matching, with a focus on improving things like nominal depth protection rather than the photographic features.That meant that even before use in anger there were some compromises\: none of the cameras in this class do RAW, even though Canon, for example, support this fully on their smaller high\-end compacts like the S95. to make things worse the TG2 also lacks many of the some other fundamental tools to control exposure such as automatic bracketing \(despite a very high frame rate which would support it well\), or shutter priority.The lack of these features is a complete mystery to me, when these cameras are allegedly designed to be used in conditions where the lighting as well as the environment will be challenging...Early trials did suggested that the camera does have accurate, fast autofocus \(which was something I particularly wanted\), and makes a decent job of auto exposure in most cases. Picture quality is OK, but the noise levels rise rapidly at ISO 800 and above, the JPEGs have a somewhat \"overprocessed\" look, and there\'s some noticeable pincushion distortion on underwater shots, even at medium zoom. These are presumably all  the result of the tiny sensor, which is significantly smaller than in compacts like the Canon S95.So, off to Barbados and into the water with the turtles. One immediate observation was that the display is very difficult to use at snorkelling depths \(where there may be quite a lot of ambient light from above\/behind you\), and the tiny font becomes illegible for a user like me with ageing eyes. A \"high contrast\" option on the display, and a large\-font \"quick menu\" option \(like on all my Canon and Panasonic cameras\) would be useful.However, a few minutes into the snorkelling session I noticed a much more serious problem\: the camera kept on switching itself off, and the battery level was dropping almost as I watched. I managed to snatch a couple of shots, but the camera was really misbehaving, and I had to give up.Back on the boat the problem was immediately apparent \- the camera had sprung a leak presumably through the cover for the USB port, as that had evidence of water inside it. However, instead of being limited just to the port section, the water had spread rapidly through the camera with the result that the lens was misting up and the electrical problems were getting rapidly worse. Although I tried drying the camera out and recharging it, it\'s now completely dead. Fortunately I had invested in a waterproof SD card, so I managed to rescue a few decent shots, but otherwise it\'s a write\-off.This is an extremely poor design. As you have to charge the battery in camera \(using the proprietary USB cable \- another peeve\), there\'s no option of just sealing the camera for a complete trip. You would also think that the camera would have some measure of \"double sealing\" so that in the event of a leak into the port or battery\/card openings the water wouldn\'t permeate quickly into the rest of the electronics, but this is clearly not the case.This camera is completely inadequate for its intended use. Fortunately my suppliers \(the excellent Wex Photographic\) have promised me a full refund. I will not be spending it on Olympus equipment.", negetive
"I\'m sure the TG2 is a good product\; but the TG2 I rec\'d would not work, right out of the box\! The monitor would not light up. All it did was show printed info. You couldn\'t take a picture, use the telefoto lens, use the menu, etc.  Unfortunately, I didn\'t attempt to use the camera until a month after I rec\'d it from Amazon\; and so I couldn\'t send it back to Amazon for replacement. I had to send it Oympus, instead, under the warranty. I hope they can repair or replace it for me.  I feel foolish for not testing the camera right away upon its arrival\; but we wanted to wait for our anniversary before we used it.", negetive
"Olympus pulled a boner with this camera and it\'s predecessor the TG 1.  Both cameras take excellent photos and have lots of neat shooting modes, but don\'t expect anything from the Video.  All video production \(except the underwater mode\) will come through with a horrible ticking noise.  Turns out it is the auto focus.  Olympus says it\'s normal and will not honor any return for this reason.  Idiots\!", negetive
"I wanted to like this camera. I bought it mainly as a travel camera and because it is waterprrof, freeze proof, drop proof, dust proof etc. It takes pretty good pictures.There is a major problem with the sound recording. There is a constant hum and it grinds, pings, beeps and makes mini jack hammer sounds when it tries to auto focus. The sounds are more than noticable when the video is played back. It also makes a loud buzzing noise when you zoom in and out.These sound issues make the video basically worthless on this camera.If olympus fixes these sound issues than this would be the perfect travel camera. In its current state it definitely is not", negetive
"When using this overpriced paperweight, I found that it was very easy and common to inadvertently put your left finger over the stereo microphones on the top completely trashing the sound for your video.  If you zoom in or out while taking a video, an unbelievably load motor whine is recorded and heard on the video when it is played back.  Even after the zoom stops, there are still strange electronic noises that linger in your video for maybe 3 or 4 seconds.  The still pictures had a strange orange fuzzy hue...no matter what I tried, I could not make them any sharper or clearer.", negetive
"Well, the fast lens is nice but it\'s not the only f\/2 waterproofer \(which a lot of people say it is\) \- the Pentax WG\-3 also has the f\/2 lens.Relative to every other waterproof compact I\'ve used \(Nikon aw100, Sony tx20 and Panasonic ts20\) it\'s really big and bulky. It\'s twice the price I bought any of the aforementioned waterproof compacts for and honestly, I would put the TG\-2 at the bottom of the pile in the IQ department \(by a big margin\). Noise reduction is terrible, yet high ISO shots look fairly reasonable \(most probably because of the NR\). This pretty much negates the lens in my opinion as it doesn\'t matter how good the lens is if every shot is going to have massive smudging noise reduction applied.Another thing I noticed is the loud zooming of the lens, especially in video, where as every other waterproofer I\'ve used has a virtually silent lens. \(No ticking though \- aka TG\-1 video\).LCD is nice. Camera looks great. I returned it. No way worth the money compared to cameras half the price or less out there right now. I am going to give it a one star ...thinking about a two star, but honestly, too much money, look elsewhere.", negetive

"I have been shooting with a Nikon AW100 for the last 2 years. Recently the AW100 was damaged and went in for repair. In the meantime I wanted to try something else. I picked up the TG\-2 in time for a fishing trip to michigan. Right out of the gate I noticed the pictures were not as sharp and while the camera shoots faster than the Nikon the images were useless.I was further disappointed with the TG\-2 when it fell out of my waders while I was taking them off. The camera fell only 2 feet to the ground but the force was enough to crack the video display. Needless to say I was unable to use the camera underwater after that.Very disappointed with this camera and I have since returned it.I look forward to getting my nikon back and trying some other cameras too.", negetive
"This is this camera but not the USA Model it is a gray market model.  I would rather have paid more money and got the model intended to be sold in the states.  I am disappointed with Amazon for allowing this vender to sell on there sight without give that information on the sight. In general I have been happy with Amazon, but they are slipping very fast.  This is the second item I received in the past three months that has not lived up to the write\-up.  Due to the fact that I bought it for my daughter to take on her trip I can not return it.", negetive

"The \"Tough\" little Olympus TG\-2 iHS is pretty to look at, but it sits dead in front of me. Amazon\'s Pavillion Electronics sent a charger cable with a European style 3\-pronged plug, instead of a standard 2\-pronged plug. I live in Oregon, so someone at Pavillion goofed. You\'d think that Amazon Customer Service would have quickly and easily ordered the right cable and have it shipped to me overnight \(I need the camera as I type this\). Instead, I was on the phone with an Amazon rep for about an hour. Most of the time I was kept on\-hold. Finally, the rep said he would call me back. He didn\'t. Instead he sent a terse email, which said only this\: \"Thank you for contacting us.\" So on my own, I had to find a different Amazon Customer Service rep. Fortunately, I found a competent and very pleasant agent, who set up an order for a 2\-pronged plug, but from a different supplier. It\'s now in the middle of the next day, and the part hasn\'t been shipped yet. I just found out that it won\'t be shipped by the fastest carrier for overnight delivery in the morning. I paid for the \$18 replacement part, and then got an email saying it would be refunded on credit card. But the email said it was for a replacement 32 GB memory card, which I ordered with the camera. The memory card appears to be fine. I tried to email a reply to Amazon about the mistake, but my email was blocked.", negetive

"We used this camera for 12 days and we we\'re very satisfied with the quality of the pictures. The Dynamic mode makes great shots\! Unfortunately, once we used it in the water, after about 15 minutes in the water, air bubbles came out of the shutter button. The camera was garbage after this. Apparently water had somehow gotten into the camera and it would not work again. Everything was completely sealed which is why this surprised us. The next 2 days were spent trying to dry it out with a hair dryer, charging it and trying to power it on. Both of these attempts only heated up the camera which fogged everything up. The lens is spotted from the inside from all the water now. We were on vacation when this happened and returned it back to Best Buy at day 16. We luckily received store credit since it was 1 day over the return policy. Did we have a lemon\? Maybe, but we\'re not willing to chance it\! I\'ve read similar reviews on the TG\-2 but thougt \"it won\'t happen to us\!\". We\'ll probably go with the Pentax WG\-3 next which is identical according to the specs. Hopefully we\'ll have more luck with the Pentax.", negetive
"Does horribly when there\'s light...even if it\'s just street lights in the background.  It blurs when there\'s light and sometimes when there isn\'t.  The only you can do when it blurs is turn it off and on again, hoping this time it\'ll focus.  Also, the contrast is super high, making all your subjects super dark.  If you ever take a picture outside, regardless of whether or not it\'s a sunny or cloudy day, the camera will always focus on the sky and not your subject, meaning half your photo will be high resolution sky and half pitch black \(your subject\)My biggest gripe though, is that I\'ve only had it for four months and already it\'s malfunctioning.  Half the times when I turn it on, the shutter malfunctions and blocks the lens, thus making the screen dark.300 dollars is definitely not a reasonable upgrade from the 200 dollar TG\-820 which I loved so much.  I accidentally got that model ran over a car and yet it still worked for a couple more months.  I think I\'m going to go back to that camera.", negetive

"I just unpacked my TG\-2 and was very disheartened to see multiple cables \& cords. I bought the camera because it\'s highly rated for low light situations and is water\/dust\-proof and shock resistant. If it performs as advertised, I will be happy to upgrade my rating. But for now, I\'m most unhappy with the rigmarole for charging the battery. The battery charges inside the camera and you must connect the camera to the battery charger via USB cable and then connect the charger to the USB\-AC adapter. All are proprietary. So, what\'s the big deal\? Well, I\'m a frequent traveler and as all travelers know, the amount of crap we have haul around to keep our computers, notebooks, cameras, MP3 players, Kindles, phones, etc charged is absurd. The last thing I want in a new camera is three more pieces of auxiliary equipment to pack and track. My other cameras \(Canon and Panasonic\-\-this is my first Olympus\) have small chargers that plug directly into the power source. Is there a good reason why Olympus can\'t follow suit\? I realize it\'s a relatively minor matter, but it was enough that I seriously considered returning the camera.1\/26\/14 update\: I bought spare batteries and a plug\-in charger, so that problem is solved. However, I finally got around to charging and installing a battery \& the camera doesn\'t function. When the battery is inserted, the camera makes a grinding sound and the screen lights up but after a few seconds, it beeps several times and shuts itself off and then makes some more grinding sounds. Once the battery is installed, it won\'t turn on at all, just makes those grinding sounds. I\'ve tried all three batteries. The rating goes down accordingly to one star.", negetive
"I\'m really disappointed in my TG\-1. I just mailed it out to El Paso, TX this afternoon for warranty repair. I\'m completely bummed... Summer is short in Minnesota and will not have my camera for use for my summer fun activities I purchased it for. I have only used it a few times and was on vacation with my family in San Diego when the back buttons stopped working. I have sent a letter via certified mail to explain my frustrations with Olympus and this model... I\'m not the first customer to take their camera to the beach and then realize that the back buttons no longer work. No menus... no videos... nothing. I think this is a great camera, just don\'t get it wet, and make sure you have a backup camera for when this one falls apart or stops working.", negetive
"DO NOT BUY \- Not A Good Product.I bought my TG2 on Monday, September 23, 2013. Except for testing at home have tried to use it on my trip last week. It shot the first couple of photos fine and then the zoom stopped working. It would zoom but was totally out of focus and the green focus lock would not come. If I took the photo it was still out of focus.  I restarted \& shot a photo without zooming, but as soon as I zoomed, no matter how little I zoomed, everything went out of focus. I tried restarting, reset from menu, different SD card \- NOTHING HELPS\!\!  I tried several shooting modes with no sign of improvements. Issue is intermittent. It works for few photos using zoom with no problems but after that any use of zoom lever resulting in out of focus.  Tried to contact Olympus through email \- it doesnt work either. Unfortunately as an apparently intermittent problem, if I send it Olympus for service it may probably work for them. I am trying to contact Olympus in all possible ways.", negetive
"I make my living as a photographer and use the highest\-end gear on a daily basis.  I have wanted a waterproof camera for years, and so I decided to start reading reviews online...  Many of them pointed to the Tough TG\-2 as a \'best\-in\-class\' point and shoot.  I have never liked Olympus\' products, so I was a bit leery, but after such across\-the\-board high marks, I decided to give it a shot.Upon my first time out with the camera, I immediately noticed a couple issues \- the first was ergonomic, the other was image quality.Ergonomics \- command dial very stiff to turn, especially with wet hands.  The arrow pad is located too close to the command dial and ends up requiring you to almost click with your fingernail instead of fingertip to make selections...  Just kind of put me off.The \#1 reason to avoid this camera is POOR IMAGE QUALITY.  With technology being what it is today, you should NOT look at a full sized image, shot at the lowest ISO \(100\) and see pixelation.  These files are super pixel\-y, even at ISO100.  Now granted, I am used to using very nice cameras, but nevertheless, IF YOU CARE ABOUT IMAGE QUALITY and printing, avoid this camera. Trust me.If all you want to do are post snapshots to Facebook, etc, I\'m sure this will do the trick, but if you love photography and good images, find another model.Lastly, I had it yesterday in the ocean, third time I have used it.  I started getting fogging inside with everything sealed up properly...  Didn\'t notice till after I had made many blurry, out\-of\-focus pictures.  Really disappointed.  Going to try and return to Amazon \- hope I can still get my money back and put it towards something better.  I should have known better than to go with Olympus after seeing the poor quality of their pro gear in the past\!  Live and learn.", negetive
"Died on first use in the ocean during my honeymoon \(Fortunately, I had the foresight to bring multiple camera but only one waterproof one\).  As far as I can tell, the water leaked in through the mode dial.  Some really fine sand made it\'s way in there \(I could here grinding\) and probably breached the seal.  The battery\/SD card compartment was bone dry when I checked.  I tested it multiple times in the sink to ensure it would work in the water which is why I\'m convinced it\'s related to the sand.A weather proof \/ underwater camera that can\'t handle a beach is utterly useless in my book.  I should have steered away when I saw others complain about this and foolishly thought it was user error.", negetive
"I bought this camera back in March when it first came out. I was looking for a durable underwater camera.Since March I have used it a handful of times and I am not impressed. I understand that when you choose an underwater camera you lose some quality. However, it takes horrible pictures whether you are underwater or not.Half of the time I haven\'t been able to use the camera because all it does is beep several times and shut off.I sent the camera away once and now I am sending it away a second time because I am still having the same issue.The technical support and customer service at Olympus is a headache. I can never reach someone that I can understand because they all have such strong accents. I finally found someone that I could make out what they were saying. No one answers your questions when you are on the phone with them. They are just silent. They always send me information on where to send it in the US when I am from Canada. It doesn\'t matter how many times I tell them I am from Canada I had to call back several times to get a shipping address in Canada.I was so excited about this camera and now I am disapointed. I spent a good chunk of money on this camera and can\'t use it. I was told that they would send me a refurbished camera if they try 3 times to fix it and it doesn\'t work. It\'s a brand new camera that has been barely used and the best they can do is a refurbished camera.PLEASE do not waste your money.", negetive
"Too big and heavy for a pocket camera. Every indoor shot we took, flash on or off, was orangish. Sent it back.", negetive
"I don\'t order a new camera very often and I was very disappointed that this camera did not include the Memory Card.  I would have included it in the order but there was no mention of it not being part of the purchase.  Now, if I order it separately, I will have to pay shipping or do down to my local camera shop and try to find it. I\'ve never had a camera that didn\'t come ready to take pictures.  The third party seller was \"Reliable Business Partners\" \- be warned\!", negetive
"The camera overall is OK, built to be tough.One major drawback is the auto\-focus area and settings, it is not configurable\; what happened to me was, during shooting the camera would focus wherever it wanted, and there is no way you could change the green\-box position.Come on, it is over \$300 and now is year 2013, I had to returned it.", negetive
"In summary, I\’m disappointed with my Olympus TG\-2.  Bought the camera for a vacation trip.  Tested it in a pool before going and worked great\; no leaks, no problems.  After 3 days on vacation the camera failed.  Wouldn\’t take pictures.  The doors didn\’t leak.  It just wouldn\’t turn on to take pictures.  I could get the GPS tracking to work and used it for that the rest of the trip.  During the first 3 days I went snorkeling once or twice a day to depths of about 10 feet.  The only thing I think I could have done better is more regular rinsing\; I may have missed a day.The camera has been repaired by Olympus under warranty.  No issues here, fast turn\-around.  Camera is working again.Picture quality seems fair, could be better but I didn\’t review the pictures until back home so I may have been able to tweak some settings or my style for better quality.  On the positive side the camera does turn on fast, take pictures quickly, GPS works, and I thought was easy to operate.  I was very happy with it until it failed.Others on my trip bought less expensive cameras, the pictures looked good and their cameras didn\’t fail.  Given the price of this camera, I feel I would have been better buying 2 less expensive waterproof cameras.  Then I would have 2 batteries plus a backup camera if the first one fails.  Whatever you do bring a backup regular camera to take \“dry\” pictures just in case.  I didn\’t, thought I had a tough camera.", negetive
"I bought this camera for around \$380 a few months ago. I chose this one over other weatherproof cameras selling at almost 1\/2 the price because of its larger aperture lens. For underwater photography, larger lens means more light means higher clarity photos.Alas, it only lasted for 1 underwater shooting. On my 2nd trip, after using it underwater for just 1 day, the camera went crazy. It still turns on, it occasionally even takes photos. But none of the menus or zoom work. Strangely, if I pop the SD card in or out, the menus suddenly become usable, but only ONCE. As soon as I select something, they vanish again.I am very anal about how I use my things and have always ensured that the double\-locking was engaged for the battery\/card as well as the USB compartments. But how do I PROVE it\? Olympus always starts with, \"We\'re sure YOU must have done something wrong\".So now I\'m stuck with a \$380 paperweight that occasionally shoots pics. BTW, even when this camera was working well, it only took clear pics in bright light. In lower light conditions, the pics are very grainy, presumably because of the image sensor itself, since the lenses are of good quality.I don\'t know if other underwater cameras are any better. But I definitely DO NOT RECOMMEND this camera to anybody \:\-\(", negetive
"Mechanically well built but very soft focus. In fact the resolution\/focus was worse than a cheap Canon SD1100 \(10Mpix\) bought in \~2008.

"As others have commented there is a very annoying noise when recording video.  I knew this when buying the camera thinking that it couldn\'t possibly be that bad.  Well, I was wrong.  The noise is horrible and overpowers anything you are video recording.  It is so bad I honestly don\'t know why Olympus would ship this half baked product, especially considering that it sounds like the previous years model had the same issue.  I honestly don\'t think that this should have been released to the market with this flaw and I am dumbfounded that after a year the problem still exists.  If you plan on using this camera to record video at all do yourself a favor and buy a different camera.  We got this mainly for still but the video audio quality is so poor that we returned it.", negetive
"If you are interested in this camera to shoot video, don\'t buy it.  It suffers from the same defect as its predecessor the TG\-1.  There is a loud clicking sound in the audio track during recording, which appears to be related to the auto focus mechanism.  Strangely, the noise does not occur all the time.  Owners of the TG\-1 complained about this problem in mass, but Olympus claimed it was just part of the design and could not be fixed.  I purchased the TG\-2 in the hope and expectation that they had found a way to fix the problem.  Not so. I returned the camera after one day of testing.  If you are buying this camera just for still photography, I think it does a nice job.  The close up capability is awesome.", negetive
"Quality of the camera is very bad. We\'ve been using Canon camera w\/ 7.8Magapixel and 3.8X optical zoom since 2007, this camera is supposed to be an upgrade and come out to be much worse. The camera is always dead\/down \(like a computer doesn\'t have enough ram and become dead\) while we switch in modes or between modes, or even try to zoom in and out. The Direct Link botton is located right at the holding spot, so when holding the camera to take a picture, most of the time this botton is pressed without you knowing it. The touch screen is not sensitive at all, I keep touching it and no response come out, really hate it\!  The Picture qualilty is so so, even with a much larger resolution, the quality is no better than my 2007 Canon camera. I have samsung phone and headphone and like them, and that\'s why I want to trust the same brand, but it is a really disappointed product.", negetive

In short, completely unreliable camera\! I wish I could return it but too much time passed, due to the length of our trip. I contacted Samsung and they were unwilling to replace it with a new camera.

I have used a dslr canon rebel for the last 5 years and just wanted a good point and shoot on the side. The quality of the pictures \(although decent looking on the camera screen\) is absolutely terrible when viewed on a computer. And though the camera does have lots of different options it really doesn\'t matter when most pictures taken are blurry, out of focus and just plain bad..I went back to Best Buy and got a Nikon COOLPIX S9500 and I am much happier with the quality. Quite honestly other than owning a dslr it is the best quality I\'ve had experience with so far.", negetive
"I purchased this camera from Best Buy... it\'s price was decent, and I like Samsung stuff.Now, after using it in the real world, I\'ve decided this was not the best camera I could have gotten for the money.Disappointments\:1. While the camera has lots of cool wifi features, they are clunky to use.2. Overall the intuitive feel for just taking pictures is non\-existent. It feels like some engineer in a cubicle who never gets out designed the menu and control systems. This is my most hated aspect of the unit.3. Picture quality for a camera of this resolution is overall lackluster. Colors are bland, even when you tinker in menu.4. The resolution and end product seems that of a far cheaper camera.5. Long zoom is nice, but crappy optics with lots of distortion, coupled with a presumably horrible image sensor turn out picturs of things nice and close up, but horrible color, focus, and quality.6. Did I mention the menu ergonomics\? UGH\!7. Connectivity\: I use EyeFi cards in all of my digital cameras... love the ease and speed and being able to copy videos and stills to my PC for archiving. The WB250F has BUILT IN connectivity, for backing up to your network \(KLUDGEY\) and to online services, such as Evernote, FB Youtube and SkyDrive \(Microsoft\) I have tried Samsung\'s \"AutoBackup\" that\'s built in, and it works, but it\'s MANUAL\! I have to go into a menu on the camera and \'do it\'. This is insane.Lastly, and this is VERY IMPORTANT\: One of the connectivity features available to the user in the WiFi menu is Skydrive, as I mentioned.I have a Microsoft account, so I thought \'hey\! I can use this, at least\! It will backup my pictures to a folder in my Skydrive\! Cool\!Well, I set it all up, and once again \(you have to\) went in Manually and selected the pictures and Videos to upload... WHAT\?\?\?\? IT DOES NOT LET YOU UPLOAD VIDEOS\!\!\!\! This is RETARDED. Ok, so let\'s at least backup my stills.So, I manually selected a bunch of pictures and uploaded them. It worked, pretty fast too.. when it was done, I almost deleted those images \(irreplaceable ones\) from my SD card, but hesitated for some reason. From my PC, I checked in my SkyDrive folder,verified that the images had properly copied, and then chose to view some of them. um... wait, something isn\'t right here OMG\>\>  ... YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.... SAMSUNG DOES NOT BACKUP THE ORIGINAL SIZE AND RESOLUTION OF YOUR PICTURES. THEY SHRINK THEM TO 1600X1200 FROM THE NATIVE 4320X3240  AND GET THIS\:  \-\-  THEY  \-\-\-  DON\'T  \-\-\-  TELL  \-\-\-  YOU  \-\-\-  THIS  \-\-\-  ANYWHERE\!\!\!\!\!This is PREPOSTEROUS.Furthermore, you cannot, to my knowledge CHANGE THIS SETTING in any menu, I\'ve searched.So you\'re on a trip, take a bazillion pics. Your SD card is full so you upload everything to your SkyDrive. Great\! DONE\!\!\!\! yay\! You erase the card and take more pictures. Get home, look at them, zoom in ONCE and suddenly you see HEAVY pixelation... gasp... so then you double\-check all of them, they are all the same... and then SCREAM OUT LOUD multiple bad words directed at the moronic GEEK engineers at Samsung.Holy crap, this is a HUGE deal. And it\'s not mentioned ANYWHERE in the menu system, docs, etc.This is completely unacceptable.BEWARE of THIS CRAPPY CAMERA.", negetive
"Bought this for my vacation to Europe.  On day 3, the zoom lens was stacked and can\'t use the camera at all.  Called Samsung tech support when I got back from vacation but tech support cannot help, saying that the serial number doesn\'t exist.  Weeks later, I got an email from Samsung tech support, asking for serial number again.  I responded to the email but I did not hear back from Samsung ever again.  It\'s been 6 months. What a rip\-off.  I ordered this camera through Amazon.com and was shipped from Beach Camera.  Will not buy any camera from amazon.com, never again.", negetive
"Slow shutter speed, although there is an option to change it, still functions very slow in every setting \& causes blurry photos.", negetive
"Zoom function broke after one use. Quality was not what was expected. Will submit for warranty fix as we have had this for under two months.", negetive
"This camera has a lot of bells and whistles which is why I bought it, but honestly my wife\'s iPhone 5 takes better pictures. Picasa web albums cloud upload didn\'t work because Google saw the camera as an unsecure device trying to hack into my account which forced me to change my password...grrrrr.  Maybe a firmware upgrade will fix this. I\'m returning the camera.", negetive
"I\'ve had numerous problems with this camera.It can take some nice photos however overall it seems shoddily put together and the housing is weak, sometimes to point that the flash is obstructed and doesn\'t always pop up when needed.Slow to view photos.The lever holding the battery in place broke within the first 2 months.Great zoom but only if you can keep it perfectly still or have a tripod, otherwise very easy blurred and you can rarely zoom out beyond x5", negetive
"The first WB250F I ordered started off working fine.  I took it on a weekend vacation to test its functionality ahead of a big trip to Hawaii.  I\'m glad I did because after a day I had problems with the camera.  It froze up when trying to switch between modes and if I turned it off then back on, it would automatically take a picture.  I returned it without hassle and ordered a second version.  I had decided to return it as well because the on\/off button on the top of the camera is so sensitive, it turns on in my purse and the battery runs down.  Disappointing because the picture quality, pricing, and size of camera were just perfect.", negetive
"I returned the camera because because the minimal direction were very confusing.  I was especially interested in the WiFi addition to the camera but there were no instructions on how to use it.  It may very well be a good camera, but I am not a good enough technician to use it.  Too bad.  I want my money back and have returned the camera.", negetive
"Not happy with this camera.  I ended up returning it for a Canon.  I had trouble uploading and using the wifi function.  More of a headache than anything.  Sorry Samsung...I usually love your products.", negetive
"camera is just fine\; however, the instructions are terrible\!\!\! For example, I made a mistake entering the date\/time data and there are not instructions about how to RESET...downloaded 160\+ page users manual and there are none there either. ...Whar a pain in the rear\!", negetive
"I really wanted to love this camera.  Samsung is one of my favorite electronics manufacturers, and it was at a great price point considering all the features.But I have to say, I am a bit underwhelmed.  Based strictly on the number of megapixels and power of optical zoom, this should be a great camera, but it consistently underperformed a beat up old high zoom Panasonic that I have had for years, that was roughly half the megapixels and half the zoom.In good light without much zoom, it took okay photos, but if you have to push the zoom much, or shoot in low light, it just didn\'t take good pictures.  I did some side by side shots at night with all the lights on in my living room, with my other camera, and the photos were noticeably worse on the Samsung.  In bright daylight its not as obvious, but I am only a snapshot shooter, not shooting anything I was planing on blowing up anyway, so it might show up if you blew any of these photos up.The manual flash deployment is kind of cumbersome, and something you would expect to be automatic these days, but at this price point, I don\'t think you can complain too much about it, but it isn\'t exactly seamless to use the flash that is for sure.Shooting time.  This has to be the worst camera I have had in over 10 years on trying to get it to take a quick photo.  I am not sure if its an autofocus issue or something else.  But whip out the camera, power it up, get an image in the viewfinder, and push the button.  It may eventually take a picture, or you may just be sitting there holding the button down, with no error beep, but no picture either.  I missed a ton of those cute shots where you see something you want to take a picture of and you have to take it in the next few seconds or its gone... well with this camera it will be gone.  Since the camera doesn\'t turn on with the flash deployed automatically, its not a flash delay \(but there is definitely some charging time when you do deploy the flash\).  It also doesn\'t appear to be related to initial power on either, as I have had the camera out and waiting and the shot comes up and you mash the button, and nothing happens on a regular basis.  When it does autofocus, its not particularly quick, and I find that the focus point is wrong more than in past cameras.Buttons, this camera kept getting turned on while inside my jacket pocket, luckily most of the time, I could hear it turn on, before it ran my battery down.  When shooting photos it was easy to  bump any number of button on the back that were not helpful when shooting picturesCase\:  The case feels very light weight and doesn\'t inspire confidence.Internet features.  I really wanted to try a camera that had this feature, in particular, I wanted to be able to back up my photos online when on an out of town or overseas trip, when I can find some free wifi.  Unfortunately it doesn\'t work really well.  First off several of the online uploads, will trigger fraud prevention even when connecting from home.  If you are at some random coffee shop or a hotel like I was its even worse as just about all of them will trip fraud prevention from a random place like that.  Also I wasn\'t able to clear the fraud prevention from my phone \(using the hotel wifi\).  Even after clicking \"Yup thats me\" on the alert emails, I was still locked out of my Google and MSN accounts afterwards, which was a pain to re\-enable, and also burned that password which you can\'t switch back to.So if by some miracle you get the wifi to work, lets use the auto upload feature mentioned in the description.  Well auto upload means going through and selecting individually every photo you would like to upload, which is a painstakingly slow process.  how about just keeping track of what I have already uploaded and ask to upload the rest\?  I thought I read somewhere, that the photos that are uploaded to skydrive and google images will not be full resolution photos either, so not really a true back up either.So I got home after having the internet stuff fall on its face whlie traveling.  So I thought I would use the wireless upload to my local computer \(very slow even though its local\) and that eventually error\-ed out with no way to figuire out what was uploaded and what wasn\'t without doing it the old fashion way.Was any of the wireless stuff useful, yes, I uploaded some photos to facebook successfully.  But if you want to multi select, you can\'t see the images clearly to determine if these are the ones you want.  You can look at the images one by one and tell them to individually upload, but that eats up a bunch more time and battery as each photo now goes through the connect to the internet, authorize on facebook process in addition to upload.  All photos upload into a directory labeled WB250F, and if you want to go in and do anything to the images like rearrange them, oriented them, add tags, descriptions etc, you better have brought you ipad for that.  But if you brought you ipad in the first place, you probably would be better off downloading them there first, where you can get a good look at them, and change orientation and then upload to facebook through the ipad.So in the end, I think it takes okay pictures in bright light as long as you haven\'t used all the zoom that they provide.  The wireless isn\'t useful for what I wanted, but was nice to do a couple of quick uploads to facebook.  While probably still a bargain at what I paid for it, I sort of wanted a bargain that still shot good pictures and had useable features.", negetive
"I really do not care for this camera at all.Seems balky to use and looks and feels cheaply made\!It is going back\!", negetive
"How can a camera have absolutely no memory\? I read all the reviews on this camera and was very excited when it arrived.  I love the features that it has and most especially the capacity to share pictures with my iPhone.  After taking one single picture, the memory was full\! I realized that there was no memory card included and no built in memory either.  I went online and ordered some additional accessories including a battery charger, memory chip and case.  In the meantime, I can not really use the camera efficiently despite installing the Samsung camera app on my phone and being able to share the pictures with my device because so far\- I can only share one picture.  Very frustrating\!", negetive
"I replaced my old cameras with this one.  I like it in white as it looks sporty.  However\;  they seemed to have forgotten one basic but big feature, image stabilization.  Ive been taking pictures since I was a child and always have to pics thst everyone wants. Now, too many pictures come out blurry. Looking into it further,  I noticed the camera doesnt have image stabilization.  After practice and being very aware of being extremely still I can take ok pictures.  However, every time I ask someone to take a group picture with me in it, they are always blurry.  Sadly I got crappy christmas pictures that I will never get the chance at again.", negetive
"I was very excited about this purchase after the price dropped so much and very disappointed when I received it and ended up returning this camera. I only had it for about a week and used it to take photos at a Beyonce concert. The optical zoom is amazing, I was able to get great shoots and you could not tell that I was far away from the stage. My problem with this camera is that it seemed cheaply made and the flash did not work properly. After holding the button down for several seconds and nothing happening I gave up. I later tried when I got home and it finally came up but then would not go down. It just seemed to be stuck. Maybe I just got a bad one and you will not have that trouble.", negetive
"this is my first \"advanced\" digital camera, as i\'m used to the \$70 point and shoot canons. i\'m still trying to get used to it, and it has many fun settings. however, i got it to take mostly inside pictures of my daughter playing. the action shot setting in inside lighting doesn\'t allow me to use the flash and is extremely dark photo. i had a professional photographer friend help me out with it, and she didn\'t understand why it won\'t allow a flash on most settings. the only setting i\'ve found that does great pictures is the beauty setting, and that\'s only if i get lucky when everyone is sitting still. i\'ve played around with shutter speeds, and everything else i could think of, not being able to get a good clear action shot inside. this camera may be too much blur for my liking. i\'ll try it a couple more days, but it seems to be looking more like returning this and going back to the cheaper canon. of course this is just my opinion, and might be more of \"it\'s not the camera, it\'s the user\" issue, but for anyone else like me that doesn\'t know too much about cameras and want to use for the same purpose, i\'d reccomend to keep looking,", negetive
"Do not buy this lousy POS. The only reason it gets 2 stars is that it takes really goof pictures BUT uploading your pix afterwards is nothing but misery. The WiFi connection DOES NOT work as advertised. If you want to upload to your computer you have to go thru a very messy and convoluted process. NOTHING about this camera is simple.", negetive
"I\'m giving this camera a 2\-star rating for several reasons.  The first being a crazy fast battery drain while shooting video...I shot 20 minutes of 1080p video and took maybe 25 flash photos and the battery was in the red...and since there is no stand alone wall charger for the removable battery you\'re stuck carrying the charging cord and wall wart everywhere you go.  I needed this camera to last through a full day if possible...and was easily able to drain the battery in just a couple of hours.  The second reason is that while it is a \"smart camera\"...I found that it is constantly shifting modes while in \'auto\'...resulting in some fairly odd looking photos where plenty of light was available and the flash should not have been thrown...or images that were too dark when you would think the flash should operate.  Which leads me to the third reason...the pop\-up flash...this \(while perhaps a neat feature\)...seems like it could easily snap off due to such a small mechanism...and I found myself having to take pictures several times in order to use the flash...the first shot I would forget to engage the small button to release the flash \(I\'ll admit operator error here\)...the second to retake the picture...and a third try to get it right....this is nonsense...I\'ve got small kids and they don\'t sit still forever.I had high hopes based on some of the reviews...but in all seriousness...some of the settings and gimmicks make this camera seem more like a toy fit for a kid.Should\'ve went with my gut and bought the Canon 330HS.", negetive
