"This one tough camera I have dropped on pavement, in a lake \[but with float collar attached\] that has captured images far better than my iPhone, and about the same weight. I used to depend upon my phone but that likely would not survive similar abuse. Downloading pictures to my laptop was simple with the supplied cable but the video needed the Quick Time player to view them, which was available for free online. Great camera\! Be careful with the GPS, it uses more power than I expected so its best to have an extra battery. Make sure to turn off the GPS if not in use.", positive
"This camera allowed us to take pictures we never could have gotten otherwise. The pictures are very very good outside, and the video is pretty good as well. Never took pictures underwater, though. But the camera did get wet, and survived just fine. I recommend getting the extras, like the floating wrist strap. We plan on taking it to water parks also, but it got a workout on our canoeing trip.", positive
"This is a great little point and shoot camera. Very rugged and I love the fact that I can carry it around in the rain if I want to. I was a little leary of the waterproof ability at first but I tried it out in a friends pool and it worked just fine. I take it everywhere with me.", positive
"Love this camera\! Very durable. I just wish it would have come with a screen protector. Takes excellent pics though\!\!", positive
"So I\'m writing this as I wait for my TG\-2 to be replaced.It flooded when I got Maytagged through a Class IV rapid on the Snake River with it attached to my life vest. Even though it\'s waterproof \- there are limits.I\'d used it for three days on the trip up until than, and managed to save the SD card and photos \- which were surprisingly excellent.It\'s small, easy to use, takes great pictures, and quite waterproof as long as you\'re reasonably close to the surface and it isn\'t churning too badly.I\'d get another one in a minute\; just recommended it to a co\-worker about to run an adventure race in the jungle in Brazil.", positive
"I live in Hawaii and spend a lot of time at the beach.  This camera is perfect for snorkeling and so far I haven\'t had any trouble using it under water.  It has some fun settings and some manual capabilities.  It has a setting for aperture but it doesn\'t have one for shutter speed.  Most of my pictures come out crisp and clear.  A little over priced in my opinion, but overall a good camera.", positive
"absolutely in love with my camera...my kids are wondering if it is mommy proof... because so far i have taken into 4 pools, in the snow and dropped it twice... still functioning.... i did lose one of the rings on the outside... but i went on line and that is more for aesthetics... plus it is cheap plastic compared to the actual camera...Some tips \(not necessarily cons...just good to know\)1\- it does not have an external battery charger, it is plugged into the wall.  you cannot use it at that point.2\- get a back up battery and purchase an extra external charger3\- I just purchased the lens...\(telephoto\)... will review that soon... i knew going into the purchase that it had a small zoom... but I did not buy it for that... it actually takes amazing pictures and there are tons of fun settings.4\- purchase the warranty... just in case... even though it is a tough camera.,.,, SHIP happens... better safe than sorry....", positive
"I bought this camera for my gf and I. We are always doing beach, hiking, motorcycle, and photo shoots. Takes amazing pictures all around. under waters are great. low light is great\! the quick shutter speed is great. all around a great buy if you are an outdoor enthusiast but still want good photos\! We did manage to break it by dropping it on kitchen floor from hand height and it broke off little plastic corner.....we were pretty bummed, but am pretty sure it was just a lemon or defect on that 1st one. amazon was more than awesome and just sent a brand new one right away\! amazing service\! new camera has been amazing and no new problems \:\). I went all out and bought the extra zoom lens and fish eye and silicone case and float strap\! no regrets only amazing pictures.", positive
"Easy to use and takes great pictures.  Was not happy with taking photos with my iPhone, so bought this camera.  Am not sorry at all.", positive
"After watching a bunch of online reviews we settled on the Olympus Stylus TG\-2.  One of the reviews showed it taking a video and being dropped, walked on, and Frozen\/thawed.  Good thing it is tough \- I dropped in on day one and it bounced off rocks into a mud puddle\!\!\!  Still works great\!  I am looking at buying a soft silacone case asap.  I recommend this to anyone who\'s hands get too cold to hang on to a camera while hiking and it slips out of your grip and bounces 3 times on rocks into 4 inches of water \(not that this actually happened to me last month\).", positive
"For one third of the price you can have a really good and always ready camera, impervious to rain, immersion in sat water, dropping, dust. It does not get much better.", positive
"Note\: I actually own the TG\-1, but the only differences are a slightly larger case \(than the TG\-2\), and a few more software features.I could go on about the 2.0 aperture and all of the good photo effect features, but the thing which has impressed me the most in the nearly 2 years of ownership and 3000\+ photos \(including 1000\+ underwater photos\) is the ruggedness of it\:I have dropped it several times\-\-the case shows definite wear on the corners, I have taken underwater photos in Aruba \(I actually dropped it here in \~30 ft. of water trying to get some pics of starfish\), Bonaire, Curacao, St. Lucia and more. But what takes the cake\-\-a few days ago, I was crossing a river at the bottom of a waterfall, and the TG\-1 fell out of my pocket, bounced off a rock, and into the river. After an hour of searching, I couldn\'t find it \(the water was snow\-melt and COLD\). The next day, I came back more prepared, found the camera downstream, and it turned on immediately\! I waited for the lens to defog \(\~40 degree water to 60 degree air\), and finished taking the pics of the waterfall\-\-worked like a champ\!Also, I have the Canon D10 rugged\/waterproof camera, and while at the aforementioned underwater locations, my wife took pics with the D10, while I took pics with the TG\-1. All of the TG\-1 photos were very noticeably better\-\-not just due to the resolution \(12MP vs. 10MP\), but the image processing, exposure and color accuracy was MUCH better\!", positive
"WOW.. The Olympus Stylus TG\-2 iHS is an amazing underwater camera\! We just got back from a wonderful vacation and took our Olympus with us to go swimming in Grand Cayman Islands and Cozumel Mexico the pictures came out clear as if we were still underwater\! My husband and I love this camera so much cant wait to go underwater again\!  Thank you Olympus for making a GREAT underwater camera\!", positive
"I have had great luck with this camera.  The battery life has not been an issue for me.  You can just knock about and not have to worry about it.  Great pictures, nice effects, and makes a poor photographer look good.", positive
"received for Christmas and have not used underwater yet but on land pictures are amazing.  What an excellent purchase for a tough, take everywhere camera.", positive
"The underwater shots were fantastic for the money, the only real competitor in its category is the NIkon equivalent and this still beats it in terms of photo quality, appearance and overall performance.Took mine to North Western Australia and it made my trip 10x more memorable. Unbelievable shots. great above and below water. The macro function will blow your mind. I could take pics of individual polyps of coral. loved it.the \"bad\"\-underwater audio amplified the zoom feature, but i mean shit \- what audio am i missing out on thats underwater\? none. You\'ll end up putting music to your videos anyway so this makes absolutely 0 difference in purchasing.\-Ive been using it for a month and seriously cant think of another reason\-get this camera", positive
"I\'m a Canon nut but I have to say this Olympus caught me off guard. My first impressions were, wow this thing is built tough and the placement of all the buttons is just right. After using it and going through the menus, I was pretty happy. Very user friendly, pics it took were really high quality and I used it under some adverse conditions while in the desert dune bashing etc... Long story short, pretty good cam\!", positive
"We were a little leary purchasing this camera, as there were some negative reviews on it, we are very glad we did.  We took it on a trip to the caribean, so we had a wide variety of enviornments to test in.First, the camera is solidly built.  It\'s not too heavy, but you know your holding it, or it\'s in your pocket.  The doors to the memory card, battery, ports, etc are double sealed and outlined in orange when not locked.  It\'s helpful, there\'s also a reminder to check for debris before taking it underwater when you close the usb port.  The camera turns on and takes a picture in about a second and a half.  Pretty respectable.  The screen is decently large and bright that you can use it well in direct sunlight and underwater.  The buttons main buttons, photo, on\/off, zoom and record, are large enought to use easily, probably with a glove too, thought we didn\'t use gloves in the caribbean.  The menu system is fairly easy to navigate, and makes review images pretty easy.Photos themseleves turned out great.  The camera focused quickly in most situations, took great, vivid shots and was all around a joy to use.  Colors were a little warmer in the photos than real life, but not terribly so.  Underwater pictures were clear and bright, with decent depth.  The \"Auto\" setting worked well for most pictures, providing well focused, properly lighted images.  There are a bunch of other preconfigured settings, night time, underwater, super macro \(which was also amazing for flowers and insects\), and others for pretty much anything you can think of.  Additionally, the panoramic setting is amazing\!  It uses the built in gps to detect how far you\'ve turned the camera, and any change of orientation, and automatically snaps the picture when the camera is turned at the right angle.  It guides you to the right position on screen.  The camera then combines the images together automatically, allowing you to see what it looks like.  It takes some time, to put them togather, but this is the best way to take panoramics I\'ve seen.A couple other notes, it requires the olympus proprietary usb connector, which is a pain, but not the worst.  It\'s not the most beautiful camera, but looks a lot better than other tought cameras.  We only tested the waterproof to about 10 feet, so I can\'t judge further, but it was salt water, and there were no problems.At the end of the day, if you\'re looking for a rugged camera that takes great pictures you\'ll want to show off, this is the one to go with.  The photo\'s aren\'t SLR quality, but they are great quality.  You don\'t have to worry about breaking the camera, and it wont weigh you down.  We are super happy we made this investment.", positive
"Took the Olympus TG\-2 to the BVI for a week of sailing and snorkeling. Camera worked great both in the water and out. Good quality pictures, easy to use and made me wish i had left the Nikon digital behind.", positive
"I was issued an older version of this camera for work and liked it so much I purchased one for a trip to the Caribbean. It takes amazing pictures, is waterproof to a depth of 50 feet and has great digital filters. This point and shoot works better than my DSLR\!I highly recommend it\!", positive
"I bought this camera after doing extensive research because I wanted something waterproof for a two\-week vacation to Hawaii. I took it snorkeling with me many times and it performed flawlessly. No leaks. The photo quality was excellent , the colors were vibrant and bright and pictures overall were just fantastic\! This is my new favorite camera\!", positive
"Anyone looking to get a compact digital waterproof, drop proof camera........THIS IS THE ONE. I have had it a little over a month and I can\'t believe how reliable this little camera is. We left the waterpark yesterday and the camera done as advertised. I wanted to put it through the ringer with the water and that\'s what I done. I was tossing this thing down 300 ft water slides ahead of me, taking pictures under water, dropping it, throwing it across the pool, you name it. It takes a beating and never faultered in any way. I would suggest getting the 32mb extreme card to go along with it as it does make the camera faster shooting. The floating wrist band was also a huge plus so when dropped, you did\'nt have to dive for the camera. I have read some reviews of water messing it up, but all you have to do is make sure the seals are clean of dirt and lint and you\'re good to go. Get one and have fun \!\!\!\!", positive
"Well, maybe not, but I keep thinking, \"what would I need the Nikon for that I can\'t do with this camera\?\" Other than extensive manual adjustments of course.My husband bought me the tg\-1 in August of 2012 and I just used it on vacation in Costa Rica for the very first time.  It does everything I want and easily too. The underwater capabilities are incredible. Auto and custom settings let me set it up for just about any situation I want by simply turning the dial, so it is very fast and easy to use. I don\'t shoot movies so I can\'t comment on that.I am seriously blown away by this camera. It is heavier than the usual point and shoot but given what it can do that is a worthy trade off.I can\'t comment yet on image quality because I haven\'t unloaded the card to edit photos but they look sharp on playback.It also has an incredible macro mode which has provided endless fun.I couldn\'t ask for more from a camera of any type really \(although raw files would be my only wish for this guy\).  It\'s just plain fun and fast and has made our vacation a lot more enjoyable for me.If the tg2 carries on these qualities then to me this is a no\-brainier purchase, especially since the price has gone down significantly since the purchase of my tg1.Highly recommended\!", positive
"This is a wonderful camera, perfect for our trip to Costa Rica\- we could take it everywhere. The only weird thing about it is that there is nothing that covers the lens to protect from scratches... But it has yet to get scratched so thats good\!", positive
"WOW. How I love it let me count the ways\! Picture,ease of use,movie recording,FAST at start up,fast lens,all great. I have other things to do today so I can\'t go on and on but this is like having a mini DSLR in your pocket. Can\'t wait to get the lenses that go with it.", positive
"Took this camera with me on our cruise to Alaska.  I was not disappointed with any photo I took with it.  I was able to carry it in the pocket of my pants or jacket without feeling bulky or heavy.  Feels solid in my hand.  The different options available helped to make some memorable photos.  The GPS never failed and was a blessing to have.  I am unable to think of a negative thing to say about this camera.  It is going with us when we travel to Italy next summer.", positive
"My wife loves the camera and is very happy with it. fast pictures so we can get my daughter without blur\:\) packaged well and fast shipping.", positive
"I wanted a camera to take snorkeling and kayaking on a recent trip to the Galapagos Islands\; this camera filled the bill.  It did a fine job on underwater stills and movies.  Above water results were very good, but if that\'s all you want to shoot, there are cameras that will produce slightly better results.  Any camera with this degree of versatility will force some compromises.  The TG\-2 is a relatively easy camera to learn to use.  The interface is fairly intuitive, and there are some convenient settings \(three for underwater shots alone\).  It also does a nice job on panoramic shots.I researched this class of cameras online \(best comparative review was on dpreview.com\) and decided on the TG\-2.  I have no regrets.", positive
"I have two small kids that love playing with my camera.  So, I needed something that was kid proof and high quality.  The Olympus Stylus TG\-2 is a great camera.  I\’ve used the camera every day for about three months now.  It seems to be indestructible and kid proof.  My little one drops the camera all the time, on the tile floor, in the dirt, etc.  One great feature is the lack of a mechanical shutter.  My kids loved to stick their fingers on the lenses of my canon cameras and open and close the shutters.  It really stands up to their abuse.  As discussed in some of the other reviews, the camera does not take very good pictures in low light.  That\’s the only drawback but it wouldn\’t stop me from buying an TG\-2 again.", positive
"The best waterproof camera i have used. Originally bought a Nikon AW110, but the picture quality was horrible. This camera takes great pictures and video, and is small enough to fit in a PFD pocket. It\'s quick to turn on, and time to autofocus\/take the next picture is quite short.This makes It easy to grab the camera turn it on and snap a picture of an animal before you have \"lost\" the shot. I can\'t think of any negatives.", positive
"I read reviews for all the rugged style cameras, watched you tube reviews and tests, read more reviews about picture quality and jpeg quality.  I settled on the TG\-2 even though it was quite a bit more than the TG\-830 because picture quality was from what I could tell a bit better.  I figure if I\'m going to really awesome places and take pictures I better get the best picture quality I can in the type of camera I\'m purchasing.  We have taken this to the pool, down water slides, and had no leak issues.  I tried a Nikon camera, and although it had good decent picture quality it was not as good, it had a lot of features, but it also leaked in a bath tub.This camera has one big downfall \- the dial to change modes is hard to turn, I\'m guessing when I am skiing or snowboarding there is no hope to change modes with gloves, and probably even without.  Other than that the lens placement in the middle of the camera instead of towards the top is also a nice advantage, less chance people will put their fingers in front of the picture.", positive
"Bought this camera for my wife for vacation. Easy to operate, fast lens, and tough enough for my wild women.", positive
"Good camera.  The macro function is incredible\-\-I was able to take amazing close\-ups of a hermit crab in its shell.  The bells and whistle settings are actually pretty good and the panoramic setting is the best I\'ve ever seen.  I was disappointed when I scraped view finder on day 2 of ownership when I brought it on a kayak trip \(isn\'t it supposed to be ultra\-rugged\?\?\) but otherwise I\'m really happy with the quality.", positive
"I\'ll start by saying I love this little camera. It\'s got a high image quality, shoots HD video, has a long battery life, and its rugged and waterproof. It also has GPS tracking, an altimeter and a compass and a very long battery life. I took it on my 2 week honeymoon in Scandanavia and never had any problems with it.the panorama shooting mode allows for some nice panoramas and it has a plethora of customized shooting options, including, portrait, landscape, food, nightshot, fireworks, underwater, underwater portrait, HDR and plenty of others.I\'ve had fun taking underwater shots.  It\'s 4x optical zoom works in all cases, both under water and above water.If you\'re looking for a rugged compact little camera that you can take with you in pretty much any situation, I\'d recommend giving the TG\-2 a long hard look.Highly Recommended.", positive
"This was a gift for my son who spends considerable time in the desert and the ocean doing research in demanding environments.  Easy to use, takes clear photos above and below water, and it hasn\'t broken yet.  He likes it.", positive
"waterproof. Automatic works well and quickly. Versatile, stylish, GPS, a stabilizer, a great photo in macro and micro conditions. Photo quality was a pleasant surprise. Brilliance is not inferior to my SLR.", positive
"We bought this camera for a trip to Hawaii.  it was so much fun taking pictures and film under water during our snorkeling adventures.  It also took great pictures above the water.  We had no issues at all with leaking.", positive
"I got this camera as a Christmas gift from my husband, I\'ve only had  it for a few days, and I don\'t like writing reviews this early in the game, but there are so many positives so far, I just had to because there are things I\'m finding with this camera that I hadn\'t seen reviewed yet. So here it goes\!\!\!I\'ve only had it 4 days because the first one out of the box on Christmas day was defective. We discussed getting a different model, but this one has so many good reviews \(on many different outlets\) we decided to try again, I\'m so glad we did\! I\'m not going to go into the toughness or compact features, they have been talked about at great length in other reviews.First, if you have owned an Olympus digital before, you know how complicated the menu options can be. We had a 3030zoom for about 16 years and it finally died, it took AMAZING pictures even at only 3.3 megapixals because of the lens quality, but the menu options were almost impossible to figure out. We knew  the quality of pictures was probably a no brainer with the TG\-2, again, because of Olympus lens quality and I was willing to take on the menu again.To my surprise the menu, though still pretty involved, has a VERY cool feature\!\! It has a cheater window at the bottom of each option to tell you EXACTLY what that feature does. \(you can turn that off if you want, but who would want to\? \:\-\}\)  With the 3030 I always had to refer back to the owners manual which was also daunting. But with the TG\-2 I only have to look at the manual occasionally because of the newness yet. So if you are worried about the reputation Olympus has with the menus fear not, they have listened to the consumer about this one\!Another really cool feature is that you can make \"folders\" for grouping pictures which is very cool if you are going to be on trips at various locations, you won\'t have to try and organize once you download to the computer, a lot of the work will already be done for you.The pictures I have taken so far are AMAZINGLY clear and detailed \(even in some not so good lighting\) and the colors just pop\! It has even out done my Cannon EOS Rebel at only 2 more megapixels. I love all of the special effects features, I\'m having a lot of fun playing around with them. \(it\'s in the \"magic\" menu\) I also took a video of my cats playing, very clear and defined. I like that you can just hit the red button to start recording, no more switching modes to do so.The one and only drawback I have found is that if you zoom during video recording you can hear the motor very clearly in the video itself. So make sure you are zoomed in and out before you start recording. Or a person could possibly cover it with music\? Not sure about that yet.If you are on the fence about this one, I highly recommend giving it a try. If I find other things about it, I will update my review as needed.", positive
"Sure, the TG\-2 has plenty of wizbang capabilities...  pre\-programmed settings to optimize various situations that range from photographing food, to lighting characteristics of portraits, night time shots, and underwater scenes.  There\'s also a series of special effects from which to choose that include fish eye, sparkle, pop colorization, and fragmentation.  The panoramic option has proved more useful that I might have suspected.  But in the end, it\'s the basics that impress me the most.  The auto setting seems to make consistently great choices that result in great photos.  No issues with questionable focus or exposure levels.  Low light scenes are rendered beautifully.  As an old science teacher, I especially enjoy the super\-macro setting that practically turns the camera into a little microscope.  Battery life\?  No problem.As an avid bicycle rider I wanted a camera that could ride along in a pannier without having to worry about rough rides, cold weather, or occasionally getting caught out in the rain.  After all, when looking for great photos, the best camera is the one you have with you.  The Olympus TG\-2 is built for the ride.  And we haven\'t even discussed the video performance\!", positive
"Very simple menu, a lot of functions, I love f2.0\!\!\! Maybe a little small buttons \(up, down, left, right\) for underwater...", positive
"I little bit unusual it does not have a lens cover, and a bit too automatic \(can\'t set the ISO\) but overall, I like it so far.", positive
"We love camping, hiking, skiing, boating, etc. Pretty much anything that gets us outside in all types of weather is what I needed a camera for. I already had a camera that takes really nice photos, but it isn\'t waterproof, drop resistant or dirt resistant. I wanted to be able to capture memories of the things we love doing, not just events that everyone brings cameras to like weddings and holiday parties. So, I researched rugged cameras and narrowed my choices all the way down to this one. And after owning it for several months now, I can honestly say I don\'t think I\'ll ever again take out my other camera.This camera has been submerged in water, dropped accidentally, in below freezing temperatures, at the beach, in the rain, in the woods... it hasn\'t missed an opportunity to capture those amazing memories. And the photos are great quality \- just as good if not better than my other camera that I babied.It\'s a great little camera that can and does go everywhere with me.I would recommend getting the \(in any available color\) tripod with this camera, so you can be in the photo too every now and then.I also have the case. The TG\-2 fits very snug in the case, but it does fit. I went with the 30 because I wanted the smallest case I could find that would fit the camera. This case was the one I liked best.", positive
"It\'s everything I had hoped for.  Super photos, easy to use, battery lasts 2 days in constant use. lens ring falls off alot", positive
"I purchased this camera to take along on my more adventurous outing. Works great in water and takes awesome water pictures. No more \" oh no don\'t get it wet\!\" It has some real cool features. Love the micro setting and rapid fire setting.", positive
"the camera takes excellent photos in and out of the water.  The camera is easy to use.  However my camera is destroyed.  I thought that I had both locks locked but they were not, I got salt water in the camera and it is now a goner.  The one complaint that I have is the locking of the SD card and the battery.  There are two locks on each and it is very hard to tell if the are all locked or not.  I would buy this camera again.", positive
"I have owned several point and shoot cameras, and this by far is my favorite.  I have backpacked for several long stents and have always been loyal to Cannon, however when the time can to get a new camera, though difficult I made the brand switch to the Tough Olympus and have never been sorry.I have had this camera, snorkeling, at the beach, in the snow, in the pool, dropped on rocks, in the desert, with me riding dirt bikes, at a baseball game and everywhere else I have been, and my favorite part is, it performs amazing every time.  The quality of pictures is amazing.  There are fun different enhancement you can choose right on the camera to make your picture take on a different appearance, similar to some of the apps available for our camera phones.The camera is easy to clean, and so far after many events in the water I have had no difficulty with any leaks.  All the moveable compartments, for battery and memory card, ect have 2 locks to make sure securely fastened to prevent such leaks.", positive
"Pictures in both salt water as well as chlorine came out great. Still playing with the \"other\" features on the camera. But I\'m still learning.", positive
"The TG2 has been a fantastic camera.  Used under water, action shots and all other variations.  Would like to try the additional lenses.  Its the one camera you can use for any ocassion.", positive
"\- easy to use menu\- fun to add the FCON filter\- the option to add a UV or polarizing filter is nice", positive
"Very responsive \- get immediate shots, pictures turn out awesome, underwater is amazing. Video was not bad either. Only drawback is it is a little bigger than smaller cameras, but still fits in a jean pocket.", positive
"Took this camera to hawaii and used it in the pool and the ocean. It did freeze once but a quick power down and it was alright. Some really amazing pictures very clear with some really cool filters. Picures and video in and out of the water were absolutely amazing\!\!", positive
"Let me start my review with some background information. I\'ve been a professional photographer for the last 10 years and a digital\-camera enthusiast since they started becoming available. I shoot with heavy, bulky, expensive equipment when I\'m working, but when I\'m having a good time with my family I look for something a little different in a camera.Right now, most of us have phones that take pretty good pictures when in good light. The problem with phones, and other point\-and\-shoot cameras is that you can\'t get in on the action very well as you\'re using them. They\'re fine if you want to be the one who\'s on the sideline trying to get the people having fun to look at you.If you\'re like me, this isn\'t good enough. I take pictures for a living, so the last thing I want to do is take more and miss out on all of the fun moments with my family.  This is why I have been snatching up the \"tough\"\-style cameras every year in search of one to love. After owning several Canons, Nikons, and even waterproof housings, last year I finally found what I felt was the \*perfect\* take\-anywhere camera\: the Olympus TG\-1. Over the last 12 months, I have really given it a beating and it\'s still working perfectly. In fact, last month I just got back from a trip to the Great Barrier Reef where it took some of the most incredible pictures you can imagine.Of course, when I saw there was an update to my beloved TG\-1, I knew I had to have one. Fast forward to two weeks ago and my package arrived. Since I\'ve rambled a bit on my intro, let me just summarize my thoughts after giving it a good dose of summer for two weeks\:Clearly, Olympus took everything amazing from the last camera, improved on it, and then added a handful of incredible features that I didn\'t know I wanted but now have fallen in love with\!\-\-\-Here\'s a BRIEF SYNOPSIS about what I LOVE\:Solid construction. This is no toy \- it\'s the real deal and it feels great in my hands.The lens is in the center. This keeps your fingers off it and makes it easy to hold during the action. \(This is also a bonus for lefties\!\)The user interface is intuitive. Unlike some other cameras I own, there is nothing buried in the menus.  Plus, nearly everything you need is right on the dial.I love the strap. It\'s thick, adjustable, and bright red. If you drop this on the ocean floor like I did, you\'ll be happy for this.The battery compartments have double locks. First you lock it, then you lock the lock. This keeps you from nervously picking it open underwater and keeps your kids from doing it on accident.The screen is big, and I find it\'s even visible in bright light and underwater through goggles.The lens goes really wide. This is great to add drama to things, but also just to capture a whole\-lotta fun in one shot. I get more group action shots on this than I do with any other camera.The camera location tags your pictures with its built\-in GPS. This is an awesome combination to Adobe Lightroom. I just import my pics and they\'re distributed on a world map. It\'s awesome to see all the adventures we\'ve had this way.The camera shoots fast. At full resolution, you get over 5 frames\-per\-second, which is the same that I get with my Canon 5d mark III. If you lower the resolution, you can get an incredible 60 FPS\! And, if you need more than that, see below\!\-\-\-Let me tell you about some of the NEW STANDOUT FEATURES for me\:1. 240 FPSOne of the features I love about the TG\-2 is the ability to shoot video at 240 frames\-per\-second. Yes, you read that right. Just think of all the money you\'d save from buying a \$120,000 Phantom HD camera\!All kidding aside, being able to shoot in this super\-slow motion mode is incredibly fun. In fact, the other night my family spent hours making all sorts of videos with this camera. The kids would do crazy dives into the pool, we had watermelon eating contests, we did skateboard tricks, threw water balloons at each other, etc. and after each video was taken, the whole family would come running up to me and the camera and watch in amazement. This kind of fun is what life is all about. We had a great summer evening being together and just having a great time. The movement, facial expressions, impossible poses, and the things that happen too fast to catch in real time, were captivating to say the least.There are two caveats with this feature which I think are important to mention. 1. There is no sound. This is because it would be slow\-motion sound and would be too slow to even sound funny. This is why when you see the slow\-motion videos on the internet, they\'re always done with background music. 2. The video resolution makes them tiny. You definitely aren\'t going to play these on your huge TV, but they\'re great to watch in a window on your computer.2. Aperture Priority ModeWhen I shoot professionally, I use AV mode on my Canons. The previous TG\-1 did not have the ability to set the aperture, but the new one does and it\'s a welcome addition. Because my shooting style is more fluid and from the hip, I\'m ok with letting the camera choose the shutter speed based on the aperture I want and this is doubly so with a camera like this. When I switch over to the A mode, I do it to blur the background and make the subject stand out. Because this camera goes down to f\/2, I can get some pretty decent results from it, especially when zoomed all the way in on my subject. For example, when I want to take a poolside pic of my daughter, I can blur the background a bit and diminish the distracting fence and signs in the background.3. Super\-Macro modeThe Super\-Macro mode is phenomenal. In fact, this is the first camera that can shoot all the way up to a tiny 1 centimeter from the subject\! It\'s literally MICROSCOPIC\! In this mode I was able to hold the camera right up to my eyeball, snap a shot, and see every little detail and pigment in my eye. A more practical way I\'ve been using this feature is for the watches and other items I sell on eBay. It really adds value to my listings \(and winning bids\!\) when I\'m able to post close\-ups of the watch dials to give the buyer confidence in my listing.Another way I\'ve been using this mode is with my children. We\'ve been running around the house \(and park, and tide\-pools, etc\) and photographing everything small and making it BIG. From hermit crabs to rolly\-pollies, my kids love getting right on top of something and \"blowing it up\!\" Most recently we\'ve been playing a game where they take the camera around the house, shoot an item, and then run back to me and have me guess what it is. It\'s been great fun and of course I don\'t have to worry about them breaking the camera.\-\-\-SHOOTING MODES\: \(most are the same from the TG1, but there are a few differences\)iAUTO \- Camera chooses the mode based on the sceneProgram Auto \(this is what I use mostly\) \- Like iAUTO, but allows you to make changes to\: flash, macro, self\-timer \(12 sec, 2 sec\), exposure compensation, white balance, ISO, sequential \(1 fps, 6 fps at 12mp, 60 fps at 3mp\), and photo size \(megapixels\).Scene mode \- Changes modes based on subject. This is a great way to ensure you get the best picture you can without having to rely on auto\-mode.The choices are\: portrait, beauty, landscape, hand\-held starlight, night scene, night portrait, sport, indoor, self\-portrait, sunset, fireworks, cuisine, documents, beach \& snow, snapshot, wide 1, wide 2, macro, pet mode \-cat, pet mode \-dog, snow, panorama, backlight HDR.If you shoot a lot, it should be pretty easy to speculate what settings each mode makes. For example, sunset mode bumping up the saturation on reds, purples, yellows\; fireworks mode using a longer shutter\-speed to get light trails\; beauty mode using a softer focus, neutral skin\-tones, etc. This being said, I have no idea what the difference would be between cat and dog mode. If you figure this out, post it in the comments\!Magic mode \- Here you can take Instagram\-like pictures in real time, seeing the effect as you shoot. Many of the effects even work for videos as well.Pop art \- oversaturated colorsPin hole \- vignette, like an old cameraFish eye \- simulates a fish\-eye lens \(really fun\!\)Line \- drawing turns the picture into something like a coloring book pageSoft focus \- like old school glamour shotPunk \- turns pictures pink and black \(actually more fun than you might think\)Sparkle \- simulates a star filter, which turns any points of light into stars \(great for Christmas lights or city lights\)Watercolor \- mutes the colors, adds line \(see \`Line\' above\)Reflection \- like a kaleidoscope \(my kids favorite\)Miniature \- simulates a tilt\-shift lens. If you haven\'t heard of this style of photography, Google it. Super fun, and something I use for landscapes when I hike with it.Fragmented \- like a shattered mirrorDramatic \- processes pictures with a \"grunge\" lookC1 and C2 \- These custom modes are incredibly useful. If you find yourself dialing in certain settings for situations you encounter often, you can just assign those settings to one of these 2 modes on the dial. For example, my brother\-in\-law likes to examine my nephews pitching on the 60fps \(3mp\) mode so he has assigned these settings to the C1 mode and just remembers that C1 mode is \"Zach\'s Pitching Mode.\" Now when he takes pictures during a game, he can just flip over to the C1 from iAUTO mode whenever Zach pitches. Super\-useful\!\-\-\-\-\-BONUS\! Here are some UNDERWATER PHOTO TIPS from my experiences\:As far as underwater pictures go, this camera performs wonderfully. Colors are bright and accurate both above and underwater, and the contrast is excellent for an underwater camera as well. This being said, let me give you some tips on getting the best shots.1. Just like with regular photography, 12 noon is the least desirable part of the day to shoot. A good rule of thumb is that the further you get from noon, the better the quality of light. Another way to think of it would be the closer to sunrise\/sunset, the better the quality of light will be.2. Even though you are underwater, there are better angles\/directions to shoot in. I haven\'t been able to come up with a rule, but when you get into the pool, test an underwater shot from each direction and you should be able to see which looks best.3. The camera has a coating on its lens designed to keep drips off when you\'re playing in the water. I can\'t tell you how many pictures I\'ve missed on other waterproof cameras when there was a drip that obscured the subject of my photo. This being said, here\'s a tip that has helped me get a 100\% success rate in the pool\: I just dip the camera in the water and peek at the lens. If there\'s a drip that has managed to stay on the coated lens, DON\'T wipe it with your finger \- just blow it off. Because of the coating it\'ll slide right off\-\-\-CONCLUSION\:As you can see, I\'m thrilled with this new addition to my camera line\-up. The Olympus Tough line has proved it can take a beating and this new model has taken what I called a \*perfect\* underwater camera and made it even better.In my group of friends, I\'m the guy everyone comes to when they want to buy a camera. When they tell me they want a point\-and\-shoot, I love it because it\'s an easy answer\: the Olympus TG\-2.If you found my review helpful, let me know\! I\'d be more than happy to answer any questions you have about this camera or any general photography questions as well.", positive

"Purchased to take on a cruise. Used above and below water with out a hitch. Underwater videos in the Caribbean were fantastic. Sound and clarity captured moments that help us relive our first cruise together over and over. Only complaint is the battery life is not what I would expect with today\'s technology. Purchasing extra batteries for our Honeymoon cruise in July 2014 and can\'t wait to use the camera again in the blue waters of Grand Turk. Recommend this camera to everybody.", positive
"I love this camera.  There is a mechanical humming noise during recording, but this camera was designed with the adventurer in mind.  I purchased the TG\-2 instead of the GoPro Hero 3, after much research.I did not buy this camera to record video at a wedding, birthday, holiday, or a picnic.  Although I could, I have other cameras for that.  I strap the TG\-2 to my backpack while hiking, mountain biking, rock climbing, and my gear while diving.  The wind noise I record while biking, or the  silence I record while on the peak of a mountain, or the noise underwater, is not important to me, nor is the mechanical noise, the reason why I wanted to record a video is to save the sights and reminisce.  And the video that the TG\-2 takes is remarkable under all conditions.  Very high quality considering how rugged it is, and that it can survive the abuse of an adventurer in land and sea.The GPS, manometer, altimeter, barometer, and compass further give the adventurer all the more reason to buy this camera. I\'m going to bring this camera on my next flight lesson to compare altimeter accuracy.The pictures are high quality in my opinion. This camera also has aperture priority and a super macro mode, which makes this camera flexible for advanced users.  There is also a high speed setting, that records at 120 or 240 fps with a reduction in video size.  I have some great lighting strike videos, an environment that is not something you would easily be able to pull out most cameras for \(in drenching rain or have a high speed video setting\).The battery life is also very good, plus is rechargeable via USB.  This means anyone with a portable solar charger can bring this on a long wilderness or backcountry camp\/hike and easily save all the memories on a few cheap SD cards... Appalachian Trail anyone\?Please understand what you are buying when looking at this camera.  If you want true broadcast quality video and audio with waterproof capabilities, buy a \$3,500 camera with a \$1000 waterproof enclosure.  That setup may weigh around 5 lbs but you won\'t have a mechanical hum noise.  If you want high quality pictures, video, and something you can literally throw into your bag and take just about anywhere, the TG2 is perfect.", positive
"I have enjoyed the camera\'s features so far \(haven\'t put the waterproof part to the test yet\) but it wuality pics and good features.  Spend the extra \$\$ and get the wide lens with it\!\!  Worth the extra money for that lens.  Would buy again and am looking forward to putting it under water\!\!", positive
"This camera does what many years ago one needed fancy Nikon\'s for.  Now, I do not use current fancy Nikon\'s and other premium photographer\'s dream cameras \- yet.  I speak from my photo and enlargement quality.  I am well aware of the advances and choice of premium cameras for professional underwater and above water cameras from the likes of professionals like Cathy Church.  And the need for great lighting.  Checking and greasing o rings each dive.  Patience.  Water clarity.  Being very still.  And I am certain that those wanting the most supreme camera on the market will step things up a level...  But for those that just want a really great camera for snorkeling or SCUBA to 50\' without a housing or several hundred with a housing, this camera is excellent.  I like it on the underwater mount with a very bright light.  And with a filter as everyone knows the further you go down... The less light and color will show up and particularily red disappears the fastest.  To have better photos adequate lighting and filter for red is imperative.  Else, just take photos in 10\-15 ft.  If you want great photos.  This camera takes great photos under and above water just as it is.  But more professional photos with lighting and filter.  Video above water and sound quality is very good.  As is video below water, but sounds there should be dubbed over with music.  Who wants to hear bubbles\?Makes a really great gift\!Just bought another for a family member as I loved it so much\!Only trouble so far is the screws hold corrosive salt, so I need to keep an eye on them, and maybe bring a toothbrush on dives for better rinse\-ability.", positive
"This product is pretty good camera, it is somewhat of a cross brid slr and point and shoot. In addition, it\'s practicle, quality of picture is more than I expected. Design, function, appearance, and overall a good purchase.", positive
"I bought this camera for my husband to use on a recent trip to the US. He was booked to do a shark dive and I wanted someone to be able to take pics underwater. I own a Canon DSLR so appreciated that a small point and shoot was  not going to produce the type of image I am used to. When I first saw one of the pics taken while he was out on a fishing boat I said to my son \" I really hope that picture was taken with the new camera as the colour capture is amazing.\" It was and so therefore I was very happy. The one single feature that caused me to buy this camera was the high aperture setting \( for me to get a DSLR lens with a setting like this I would have to spend close to \$1000\) and the Aperture priority mode. I have some great shots of hubby with the sharks as well as a some great low light pics. Some of the reviews have been really harsh but I think people need to understand this is a small, point and shoot camera not a DSLR. It is packed with features and without reading the manual I was able to work out how to use it. Hubby did not have any problems with it not being watertight and it is now back home with me as dry as they day it was delivered. I ordered it from Amazon and had it delivered to an address in the US when it was on sale. It was around \$200 cheaper than I would have been able to get it in Australia if I had been able to find a site or store which sold it\! So overall I am very happy. If people are having problems with the quality of their images it may have more to do with the settings than with the camera. Do some reading and find out how to take great shots\! I haven\'t experienced any problems with the buttons being too close together although as a woman my hands are obviously smaller than a man. Bright light, low light the pics have all come out really well.", positive
"I just returned from a cruise to the Western Carribean last week. I purchased the Olympus Stylus TG\-2 camera to use as our primary camera for our trip. I love my Nikon D400, but it\'s too bulky and not waterproof. The picture quality on the Olympus is amazing. Both indoor and outdoor pictures were super sharp and bright. Under water pictures during our snorkling excursion was amazing. Everyone who travelled with us were amazed at how sharp the pictures turned out, especially outdoor pictures. I\'m asian and I\'ve always been a fan of Sony digital cameras, just because it\'s Sony. I never thought about buying an Olympus camera and decided to give it a chance. This camera is awesome. If picture quality and clarity is important to you, this camera will deliver. It has other bells and whistles like GPS that I didn\'t try.", positive

"\=\=\=\=\=\=\=\=\=\=\=\=\=Updated Jan 5, 2014\=\=\=\=\=\=\=\=\=\=\=\=\=Original comments stand \- very happy with this cameraFlash pictures with dark background are particularly well exposed \- fill flash also greatcontrol dial for changing modes is hard to change \- impossible with gloves onScreen is very hard to see underwater with googles on \- almost useless at times, I resort to aim\/frame by guessing and shoot a lot\=\=\=\=\=\=\=\=\=\=\=\=\=End Update\=\=\=\=\=\=\=\=\=\=\=\=\=I\'ve only had this for a few days and will update the review in a few weeks with more detail.My first impression is that this is a great little carry\-everywhere camera.You get this one for toughness first of all, and that it is. see the specs \- but you will be able to take this in the pool, in the ocean, oncamping trips , skiing etc, with no worries.The image quality is good at resolutions most people use.If you view\/exchange pictures in emails or on the web, you will be fine. If you want to make mural size photos, this is not for you.The image colors and saturation are great \- right off the camera most pictures are well exposed.handling is wonderful, especially with the small finger grip on the front of the camera.GPS is easy to use and accurate. magic mode filters are fun to play with but might get old \- I would have added a black and white filter. Nothing more fun that setting the magic mode to fisheye and talking a selfie from the sink full of water looking up\!The aperture priority mode will not be used by most people. it\'s partially only useful \- with 3 preset aperture settings, not all values.setting is thru the back controls and menus, not via a dedicated dial \(understandable for this price range\)It would be nice to have a RAW output mode, and to be able to apply filters after the image is taken,depth of field is pretty large, given that the lens is 4.5 \- 18 mm \(25\-100mm in standard 35mm equivalent\)some have mentioned that the controls are hard to use with gloves on \- that is correct. I don\'t see this as a big impediment,also, some have mentioned that the LCD \(OLED\) screen is hard to see in bright light \- I can\'t verify this yet as I\'ve had no problemsIn short, the best camera is the one you will carry with you and use, and this is a good and capable package that is easy to carry and you won\'t worry about water, dirt, snow etc.", positive

"I researched extensively before making this purchase. The results of my research were essentially a dead heat between this model and the Lumix TF\-5. I bought the Lumix. Because of its remarkably poor image quality, especially in low light, the Lumix was returned within a week and I bought the TG\-2.This is an outstanding camera \-\- for what it is.  And what is seems to be something that many reviewers don\'t understand.These cameras are essentially ruggedized point\-and\-shoots. Comparing their image quality to what you get from a full\-frame DSLR or a crop\-factor DSLR or even a \"bridge camera\"  is ridiculous. For what it is, this camera\'s IQ is excellent. And the macro mode is superlative.These cameras are not high\-end camcorders. Nor is their video as good as what you\'ll get from a crop\-factor DSLR. For what it is, this camera\'s video output is excellent.I\'d like to address two of the more common criticisms of this model in more detail\:\(1\) Poor audio. My model does not produce the constant noise that some users report. But it does pick up  handling noise and lens motor noise. \(A tip\: If you are constantly zooming in and out, your video is going to look amateurish in the extreme. If you want to get closer to something, use your feet.\) Anyone who expects great \-\- or even good \-\- audio from a ruggedized point\-and\-shoot is living in a fool\'s paradise. It ain\'t gonna happen.If ambient sound is important, you need to record it on an external device, something like a, just like you would if you were shooting video on a DSLR costing a few thousand dollars. When I need ambient sound, I mount the camera and the Zoom on an old, lightweight flash bracket. Works like a charm, and using the flash bracket helps to stabilize the camera.\(2\) The attaches loosely and falls off easily. I hate to be the bearer of some pretty obvious news, but you\'re not putting it on correctly. Align the white dots on the camera and the ring. Twist the ring clockwise very firmly until the dot on the ring clicks solidly into place at 9 o\'clock. It will not fall off\; in fact, significant torque will be required to remove it.If you need a ruggedized camera, I highly recommend the TG\-2.", positive
"beautiful quality images in and out of water.definitely worth every penny.The only real limitations is manual controls and no raw format support.But this is not meant to be a professional camera replacement, it is meant to be an entry into underwater cameras.We where down in baja california, snorkeling and fishing, and it was awesome.As long as you are careful with all the locks being set properly, avoiding getting sand and obstructions getting in the seals it works great.The camera tells you when the latches and doors are not set correctly or if there is an issue with the seals.it was also great fun to use making surreal pool portraits and other optical tricks with water.GPS is fairly accurate although very very slow.Altimeter, was ok, it work fine going down, but testing it in plane it could figure out anything past 5899 feet.compass was fun, and also worked, in fact a couple times during our bag packing trip, I used these functions to figure out where we where on map, because our gps died. \(garmin sucks\).for some reason it comes with the ability to swap out the face ring, which is actually more annoying then anything with a product you want to be very secure feeling.I hope the next version gets even better\!", positive

"This camera takes wonderful pictures and its tough as can be. True story I lost it in the snow while taking pictures, the temperatures were negative 20 and it laid in a foot of snow. I couldn\'t find it for a week until the snow began to melt. I found it next to the road and had been ran over by countless cars. As soon as i picked it up, it turned on and continued to take excellent pictures. This is a wonderful camera and would suggest it highly to anyone who loves taking pictures and the outdoors. Its Perfect. I love it\!", positive
"This is my third Olympus \"tough\" kind camera \(the first was lost at bottom of waterfall in muddy water while cliff diving \-another person, not me\- and the second filled with salt water due to operator error \-me\- when I didn\'t seal the battery compartment.\) I especially like the double locking system so the \"operator error\" is more difficult but primary benefit of this camera over my previous versions is the lens coating \(I wish it had a built in cover\) that reduces water spotting. Works Great.Other things I especially like about the camera, and telephoto lens I also purchased for it, is that the special scene modes match the way I primarily shoot \[sunsets, bright beaches, and hand held night shots\] and works very similar to my prosumer DSLR. I can let the camera\'s built in sensors adjust for those modes or I can set them manually on both cameras in almost identical ways. Very convenient.I highly recommend this camera, especially if you can get it on sale.", positive
"I bought this camera for two reasons.  One, it is a weatherproof and shockproof camera \(which does come with limitations I have discovered\).  I enjoy hiking and backpacking and wanted a camera that could withstand rain, snow, sand, cold temperatures, and everything else imaginable. This camera puts me at ease...I can throw it in my pocket\/pack or hang it around my neck on a lanyard and not worry about it getting scratched up.  It has a sturdy feel to it, which I prefer. It takes wonderful photos of landscapes \(the panorama feature is a huge bonus\).Number two, the macro abilities are amazing on this camera.  It can get up to 1cm away from an object and take a very detailed shot.  I take photos of plants and flowers, so this is the best feature that it offers to me.  The quality really is sharp and vibrant, but natural.I bought this camera on Amazon because I was given an Amazon gift card.  This is my first experience with Amazon and they have been outstanding.  I dropped the camera \(from my hand at a height of 4 feet off the ground\) on a greenhouse floor the other day, and, to my surprise, the corner of the camera cracked.  This seems to be a design flaw since the aluminum casing covers only the front and back of the camera.  The corners appear to be made of plastic \(and the chance that the camera will fall on these corners seems very high\).  The aluminum is very shiny \(in the red color at least\)\; at first this troubled me, since it looked very scratch\-able...but the aluminum part of the camera does seem quite durable.  Despite the shockproof limitations, I really do love this camera.  I don\'t intend to use it for underwater purposes, but it serves my needs for a rain and snowproof camera very well.", positive
"I was anxious to get one of these cameras and was not disappointed. This is a great, tough and solid camera. I have not tried it under water but feel certain it would do well. Everything else about it is very good. You will read about some background noise when shooting videos and it is caused by using the zoom feature on the camera as the very sensitive microphone picks up the noise when zooming in and out. I don\'t shoot many videos, but to help that problem I either avoid zooming in when shooting a video and you can also just walk closer to the subject instead of zooming in. It\'s not a big deal to me, even with the background noise. Again I am pleased that Olympus switched to the SD card instead of the XD cards they used in years past. Two reasons, the SD card is available almost anywhere at a reasonable price, and the next reason is, I use a lot of Trail Cameras and they all use SD cards. You can just pop the SD card from your trail camera into the Olympus camera and view your trail camera photos right there in the field. Very handy feature. The on\/off button on this camera is bigger and much easier to turn on and off than some of the older models were. Another feature I like on this camera is that I shoot a lot of self timer photos in my hunting ventures. Once you set this camera on self timer, it stays on self timer till you turn that feature off or turn the camera off. Some of the older Olympus cameras you had to turn the self timer on for each shot you took. That was pretty cumbersome and not so handy. My major use of this camera is for taking photos and this camera takes great sharp clear photos. It is a simple no brainer operating camera. If you are a little bit technology challenged you will find this camera easy to operate. I had trouble showing my videos at first and called the Olympus support group and they were very helpful. I had not downloaded the Olympus set up software on my computer. After I did that everything went smooth. You have to watch your videos on the Olympus software on your computer. The software disc comes free with the camera and the operating manual is on that disc also. You also have to have Quick Time on your computer to use the software and that is available as a free download on line.  You can look at your photos on the Windows Photo Viewer or the Olympus software. I don\'t think you will go wrong with this camera if you want an easy to operate point and shoot camera that takes great quality photos.", positive

"I\'ve been testing the camera since a week and got good results. Normally using an SLR and another second high quality compact \(Sony DSC RX\-100\), this is basically my third camera for beach days. My main idea was to have a camera which is good enough to leave the others at home without feeling sorry every time. Great feeling to throw it in the sand on the beach without having to worry and simply wash the dirt off at home. Underwater, it also worked very well, sharp and crisp colors and easy to operate. The manual controls are good enough as well for this purpose. I have not tried any accessories yet and don\'t think I need anything else than the camera itself.", positive

"I returned my TG\-1 ihs for the annoying noise on its videos. Apart from that, TG\-1 was the best outdoors camera I have ever had. Reading the negative reviews about the same problem with this new model, made me a bit nervous because I had already ordered the camera. When I received it, the first thing I tested was that ticking noise on the videos. The noise problem is almost fixed, both in IS mode on or off. If you record in a very silent room, and the point of focus is changed, or the camera shakes, you may notice a very low un\-annoying noise on the videos. Only those who want to hear it, will hear it.The super macro mode, the new feature, is amazing.The autofocus works very fast and smooth in regular indoor lighting.HDR feature is very good and useful.I recommend this hardcore camera to everyone, either outdoor adventurer or regular vacation photographer. It is a good investment.", positive

"Excellent picture quality and durable camera.  Took it on a trip to Maui where it survived scuba diving \(18 \- 30ft deep\), being dropped on volcanic rocks and hit against body boards during failed attempts to body surf near Hana.  No issues with batter life.  It\'s a nice looking piece of equipment and for the most part, very easy to use.  Only hiccup we had was not knowing to put the camera in underwater mode before scuba \(has to do with the intensity of the flash\) and the option was not the easiest to find.If you\'re looking for a rugged, quality camera and aren\'t scared by the price tag, you won\'t regret it.", positive
"I had been wondering about which point and shoot could go out with me camping, endure exposure to the outdoors and still produce some very good images.  After checking out a couple of review sites, I decided to take a chance on the TG\-2.  I was not disappointed.  I have still not used the video functions, this isn\'t a big priority for me.  But the quality of the stills was even more than I expected.  A great point\-and\-shoot with the versatility to give you quality images in almost any environment.", positive
"Love everything about this camera, but the \#1 reason is MORE LIGHT.  I am a commercial photographer and will keep it with me all the time.  The photos are gorgeous and I will invest in the telephoto lens.  The only disappointment was the little ring around the lens.  Fell off on the chair lift, so I am down one. Also bought the extra batteries w\/charger kit \(a good idea because otherwise you are charging the battery while its in the camera\) and the screen preserver in the kit is junk.  This is a tough camera, probably the best, just figure out how you will protect the lens and the LCD.", positive
"Really love it, took it to Belize for adventure, captured everything.  One drawback, hard to see what you are shooting at underwater but mostly point and click.  Great images and mini movies.  A word of advice, when snorkeling and taking underwater pictures, get close to subject or keep it on zoom if taking pictures from the surface.", positive
"The \"super macro\" mode with LED flash is fantastic, especially for underwater macro shots. I use this for snorkeling and tidepooling, as well as for photographing insects and plants. The camera is very sturdy and lives up to its name. I bought it because it was one of the few underwater point\-and\-shoot cameras whose reviews didn\'t mention leaking or water damage as one of the problems, whereas many of the other \"underwater\" cameras seem to have frequent issues with leaking. We previously bought a cheaper olympus underwater camera \(one of the earlier stylus \"tough\" cameras\) and had to get it replaced twice because of leaking.", positive
"Bought the TG\-2 for a vacation in Guadeloupe in the French Caribbean. Did not have time to really familiarize myself with the camera before the trip, and used it in auto mode only. Even in auto mode, the resulting images showed the potential for this camera. I used it extensively while snorkeling in the Jacques Cousteau Underwater Park and the photos were very good, both in sharpness and color. With more experience and using the manual settings, There was little shutter lag and the camera turns off and on quickly \(to conserve power\). I hope to get excellent pictures in the future. I had no issues whatsoever with leakage\; however, those using it in the ocean should adhere to Olympus\' instruction to soak the camera in fresh water after using it in the ocean \(probably to avoid salt crystals and problems with getting good watertight seals\). The battery life is relatively short compared to more mainstream point and shoots, but I feel that this is a minor negative. Recommend highly to anyone seeking a \"cross\-over\" camera. The biggest negative is that they don\'t include a hardcopy manual\; I spent an extra \$10 and ordered one directly from Olympus.", positive
"I know cameras. There are a Lot of complicated cameras that people use as simple point and shoot and never take advantage of the incredible features. That said. If you want a camera that will do everything you want it to do and you can learn and play with it in about 1\/2 hour, this is it\! This is a wonderful camera. Great for underwater photos and videos \(with a housing\) \(why risk a \$370 camera when you don\'t have to\?\) As far as a video camera, I took our wedding vids with it and pulled stills off of those.  Realistically, If you want a video camera go buy one. But for stills under various light and action conditions you cannot go wrong. As far as people saying it leaked the first time on a dive, etc. Well it is built to be waterproof to fifty feet or so. If you have one speck of dust or one micro fiber from a towel you just threw away your camera. Buy a housing. Treat it like you are building a space shuttle when you put it all together. Use it hard and clean it all up when you are done. Take care of your investment and it will work great and provide you with wonderful photos\!", positive

"I\'ve owned many Olympus cameras over the years and several of the tough series cameras.  As is the case with all electronics and especially cameras, they have their quirks and limitations.  The first advice I can give is to READ THE OWNER\'S MANUAL.For high quality, above water, I stick with the Ultra\-Zoom models of Olympus.  They are compact and their big lens provides plenty of light.  The massive zoom range lets me do just about anything I want and I don\'t have to carry or change out extra lenses.Once you go underwater, or into environments where the camera could get wet, the Tough Series from Olympus does an awesome job.  Just be clear they also have their limits and there are maintenance steps which MUST be followed.  The TG2\-IHS is the newest upgrade in the Tough Series and the best so far.  The lens is bigger and faster, allowing for quality photos in a wider range of situations than earlier models.Some of the complaints and low ratings on this page are about video noise and clipping.  This is true with the factory settings and are typical of most compact cameras primarily designed for still shooting.  However, on page 37 of the owner\'s manual, this is covered by two settings which can be adjusted to reduce wind noise and another which specifically eliminates the \"clipping\" noise.  Once these were set, the audio recorded was just fine.The biggest issue is water protection.  First, realize the standard is \"water resistant\" versus \"waterproof\" and if you want 100\% waterproof, nothing beats a specialized underwater housing.  The key to keeping your TG2\-IHS dry inside is maintenance of the seals on the doors and following the procedures in the owner\'s manual.  I will address the Olympus supported techniques and give you a couple which Olympus might not support, but do make a difference.The door seals degrade over time, mostly due to people getting into the door area a hundred times to pull the memory card and run off to print photos, plug the camera into their TV for a quick peak, or do an excessive amount of downloading through the USB.  Limiting the number of times the door is opened and LOCKING the latch, will save a lot on wear.  Olympus also recommends replacing the gasket annually.  Also, if you\'ve been in saltwater, the long rinse\/soak in freshwater is necessary to prevent the formation of microscopic salt crystals which wear the gasket and cause leaks.  Do not skip this step.Though Olympus may frown on these ideas, I do a TON of underwater video and photos, so I have learned some tricks which help.  I usually stretch clear plastic wrap over the door areas as an added barrier just before diving.  If I think the seals are a bit weak, a light coating of silicone grease on the seals will add a barrier.  Finally, if you suspect the seal is weak and you still need to shoot, placing some clear plastic wrap under the door before you close it, so the wrap gets between the seal and the door will help.  These are not supported by Olympus but they make a difference.Finally, about the 4X zoom being too limited.  I agree about that to a point.  Above water it is horrible if shooting at a distance, but that is where the Ultra\-Zoom excels.  Underwater, long zooms do not work well unless you have tons of light and a huge lens.  For video, 4X is plenty.  Trying to shoot long zoom underwater as video seems like a good idea, however remaining focused on a moving fish is difficult and the resulting background blur as you pan around will make you dizzy.There is a dizzying array of features on this camera and even more options.  Reading the owner\'s manual and following the instructions will get you the results you desire.  At the same time, placing the camera in Auto or Program will allow the typical \"point and shoot\" user to be happy.  Just don\'t expect the camera to be in Auto and mind read that you needed to be in Macro or one of the SCN \(scene\) specialized settings, then blame the camera.", positive

"Great little \(ok not so small\) camera. The f2 lens and processor make it easy to get a good quality image. Macro function works well and it has remained water tight. Various functions allow you to capture more then other point and click cameras. Downfall...the plastic lens ring and 4x optical zoom. But, I would buy it again to serve as a nice point and click.", positive
"This is probably the best camera on the market right now and the price is hundreds if not thousands less than its competitors. This camera competes with and smashes on the latest Digital SLR cameras.This camera...will fit in your pocket, a DSLR cannot.\-can be dropped from 7 feet, good luck with your DSLR.\-is water proof, there is no chance your DSLR will hold up to water.\-The manufacturers want you to get your DSLR wet because they are designed to break. Thus they\'ll make a quick thousand off of you when you buy a replacement.\-is freeze\-proof, very useful if you want to take pictures on a snowy day or leave it in the car overnight on a cold night.\-is dust proof, well just watch what happens to your DSLR if you get some saw\-dust on there, it probably won\'t turn on anymore.\-is also crush proof, apparently a 220 pound person could stand on this thing and it\'s fine.My last point and shoot camera was the Canon G10 which easily performed the same way as a DSLR and I\'d say this camera takes equal pictures to that, with a little bit less control.The button placement is all correct, and the internal computer is very good.COMPLAINTS\:The only complaints I have about this, compared to that, are that it lacks Manual mode and Shutter\-Speed priority mode.This won\'t be your ideal camera to take out and do a long exposure of the stars.It also has C1 and C2 on its wheel style mode selector, that DO NOT SAVE. \(Or I have yet to figure out how\)Pretty annoying when I want my custom modes to exclude flash and every time I turn the thing on I have to shut off the flash.Normally cameras also have built in option to change the pictures colors \(such as sepia, or B\&W\), this doesn\'t have that.I have had difficulty doing ANYTHING with the videos. For some reason Olympus doesn\'t want you to be able to import them to your computer, or to the internet, you may only view them on the camera or in Olympus Viewer. What the \*\*\*\*\? I\'m sure there is a way around it but they sure don\'t make it easy because I have yet to find the proper solution.If you consider yourself a photographer of any caliber, I recommend this to you. You WILL find it replacing your DSLR.Don\'t catch yourself saying \"I wish I brought my camera.\" This one you can bring with you everywhere.", positive

Do not over look the fact this camera has a very fast lens, that was the final key that lead me to going with this camera. Do not over look that feature, often my nicest fish come at dusk as the light is fading and I am very surprised just how dark it has to be before the flash needs to be used. And I would say my very favorite feature is the extreme close up mode, if you like close detail shots of things such as bugs, plants, flowers, etc. this does a great job. I am shooting a lot more photographs since getting my hands on this camera. Also, I would recommend getting a large card for that reason, I went with a 32.", positive
"Took into ocean many times while on vacation and guess what\? Yes it took on water. How, where\? No idea all the locks where locked, everything was secure. But my heart sank when I was snorkeling and seen the screen produce disortion and then go out. I let the camera dry out and pulled the battery and card as soon as I got out of hte water. But no luck it is waterlogged. Olympus was great in their service so far. I do mean so far, I had to send it back in for warrenty repair. Yes it is covered under factory and of course I bought a 2 year square deal warranty from amazon. So we\'ll see what Olympus says. Still waiting, it has only been 7 business days, you are to give them 10 days to look at and inspect. The card is ok I uploaded my video and pics when I got home. Pics are great quality and the video is wonderful. I was not the only one who had trouble, a few divers with their gopro also had issues even having the outer case, it still filled with water. I don\'t think there is a water proof camera out there. Can someone prove me wrong\?Haven\'t taken into ocean yet have taken and used at a event, many feaatures to choose from. takes great shots in huge formats , make sure you have a card large enought to handle. Taken a few upclose shots and the auto setting handles with ease.

"I was a little hesitant about buying this camera because of all the negative Amazon reviews, but a friend who owned the older TG\-1 told me how good it is for underwater pics, so I purchased the TG\-2 for a Caribbean trip \(I bought it from a camera store since I needed it quickly for the trip\).  Now that I\'m back \& thoroughly tested its daily use for a week, I can say that is is an awesome camera\!  We went snorkeling along the coral reefs, sailing, ocean swimming...., and this camera took some beautiful \& clear pictures underwater, over water, and on land. The pictures are not perfect like it would be with my DSLR, but pretty close\!  I can\'t say if the waterproof rugged features will still be perfect after a year or more, but after 7 days of daily water submersion for hours each day, it works like new \(I followed the directions to soak in over 10 mins. of tap water after each day \& let air dry\).I even tried videotaping during snorkeling \& sailing, and the videos were beautiful.  Of course, this is not a professional camera used by documentaries, so if you are diving deep where there is little light, the images will be dark.  But in decent light, the underwater images are beautiful.  I do agree with some reviews that say you can hear the camera focusing mechanism when you videotape a quiet scene\; so I just turned off the microphone during my snorkeling videotaping \& the video is sound\-free \& ready for you to add your own music. This camera is not meant for recording classical symphony music, so it\'s not fair to compare the audio to a dedicated camcorder.One negative aspect is that the zoom can\'t zoom very much\-\-just 4X\; there is an additional attachable lens that you can buy that allows more zoom, but this cost more money.  This was sometimes limiting, but overall not significant for me.On the plus side, the special preset functions work well to give you the best picture without too much adjustments.  The Macro function is better than my DSLR because you can get within 1 cm of the object.Anyways, if you are looking for a waterproof \& rugged camera that captures fun water activities and sceneries, then you will like this camera. Note that if you plan to use it in the ocean, you should buy a float strap to keep it afloat in case you drop the camera\!", positive
"Love it, love it\!  Love the GPS on it.  Love the fact you can make a video and take so many pics.  You do need to get your on SIM card.

Really neat.", positive
"Update\: google moron smugmug to get an idea what this camera can and can\'t do \- there is a clicking noise in the videos occasionally and the autofocus struggles in low light but the camera will survive just about anything you can throw at it\-\-\-\-\-Besides the waterproofing\/toughness \(I like to kayak\) what attracts me to the TG\-2 are the fast 2.0 lens speed, the aperture priority mode, the OLED screen, the primarily positive reviews of the TG\-1 and most importantly the ability to add the TCON\-T01 telephoto converter lens \- birds are difficult to photograph with only a 100mm \(35mm equivalent\) lens so I was eager to see how it all came together.\(If you\'re getting an accessory lens I recommend taking the extra effort to track down Olympus\' CLA\-T01 adapter instead of buying a third party product as the OEM item includes a lens cover. I have no affiliation with Olympus.\)So far the results are exceeding my expectations, particularly the telephoto which allows optical zooming to roughly 170mm \(as I understand it the digital zoom gets you around 340mm\)\: even at maximum zoom the image quality to my eyes is good which I presume is largely a function of the fast lens speed. Please see the three customer images I uploaded for examples of what the telephoto lens can do.The camera feels solid in your hands and the buttons seem like they aren\'t going to wear out anytime soon. I also like the mode dial which allows you to avoid manipulating some menu screens \- IMO one of the banes of digital cameras.The  microscopic macro mode gave me new perspective on my right thumbnail which had recently been broken and accordingly trimmed short \- see customer image taken with only natural light which reduced depth of field.I tested the video\: the microphone recorded clearly the birds chirping nearby and the muted noise from the interstate quite some distance away. Keeping in mind how comparatively quiet it was I could hear the zoom, most noticeably when zooming out and approaching the widest angle position. I reckon if you were recording any kind of noisy environment it would be difficult to hear.I haven\'t quite bought in to all the gizmos \(\`magic art filters\' etc.\) but they\'re there. The GPS is nifty but I\'m concerned it will reduce battery life appreciably although I really don\'t know how big a deal it is... you can turn it off.It\'s early on but I think this camera\/lens is going to suit my wants very well.", positive
"Having used a lot of different point and shoot cameras, this is the must have one. I am very picky when it comes to cameras and functionality...you can\'t go wrong with this one especially for the price. We looked at the Nikon waterproof at Costco, but given the poor reviews, we opted for this one. Very much the right choice.We just got back from a week in Hawaii and used this camera more than the Canon SLR. This little guy went every where with us...pool, beach, snokeling, shallow diving, etc. The camera shutter speed is quite fast for a point and shoot. Lots of fun and easy settings as well. From the other reviews, we did leave the GPS off and did not have any trouble with battery life. We recharged every night and did not need an extra battery.The only really minor downsides are the wheel to change modes is hard to turn if you fingers are wet. Also, I do wish there was more control of the flash for fill\-in on some of the different SCI settings. That said under the P setting, you can pretty much program anything, so there is a way to achieve the right flash fill and other settings.If you are looking for an all around great little point and shoot that can go anywhere, I would highly recommend taking a close look at this one.", positive

It is not too large and it does look stylish.I used it when I recently went tubing down springs in Florida and it worked very well. It\'s neat to look at the lcd screen while above water while taking pictures and jumping from water shots to above watershots seeminglessly.The only issue I have with the camera thus far is that the LCD screen already has a small scratch on it. I assumed it would be durable like the iphone screens and wouldn\'t scratch so easily. I now ordered a LCD Screen Clear plastic cover so that it will pick up any future scratches.

Wow it survived. The only thing is he camera got rattled from the concussion so the film didn\'t process. Sorry guy\'s. But it still works. I accidentally broke the little latch this weekend on our canoe trip on Buffalo river thinking it would be okay from getting wet. Well guess what we tipped over twice and the camera got wet on the internal ports of the usb ports. Didn\'t find out till 3 hours later. Pulled the battery out and let it dry out in the trunk for the remainder of the trip. Put the battery in today ,works perfect. Just have to get the latch fixed and it will be good to go again.

"There\'s a salutory lesson here about not jumping to premature conclusions. Based on my first impressions of this camera I had mentally started drafting a review based on praising the hardware, but with some criticism of the software and firmware. I even had a great tag line\: \"A camera for adventurers who want a few pictures, rather than photographers who want adventures\". That was before the snorkelling trip...For many years now if there\'s been the prospect of either snorkelling or diving on holiday I\'ve taken a Canon PowerShot S\-series or G\-series camera with its waterproof housing. I\'ve had at least three generations of that solution, which have been utterly reliable and produced some good results. However they are a bulky solution in these days of reducing baggage allowances, and somewhat slow and clumsy in operation.This year, therefore, I decided to try a different solution, and opted after some deliberation for one of the new \"ultra tough compacts\". While Canon and Panasonic both have a comparable solution, after some deliberation I went for the Olympus TG2, based on a combination of its looks and spec.This is supposedly a very tough piece of kit \- waterproof to 15m, drop\-proof to 2m, crush\-proof to 100kg and with a large operating temperature range. The downside is that this is a market where the competition is intense but based on point for point feature matching, with a focus on improving things like nominal depth protection rather than the photographic features.That meant that even before use in anger there were some compromises\: none of the cameras in this class do RAW, even though Canon, for example, support this fully on their smaller high\-end compacts like the S95. to make things worse the TG2 also lacks many of the some other fundamental tools to control exposure such as automatic bracketing \(despite a very high frame rate which would support it well\), or shutter priority.The lack of these features is a complete mystery to me, when these cameras are allegedly designed to be used in conditions where the lighting as well as the environment will be challenging...Early trials did suggested that the camera does have accurate, fast autofocus \(which was something I particularly wanted\), and makes a decent job of auto exposure in most cases. Picture quality is OK, but the noise levels rise rapidly at ISO 800 and above, the JPEGs have a somewhat \"overprocessed\" look, and there\'s some noticeable pincushion distortion on underwater shots, even at medium zoom. These are presumably all  the result of the tiny sensor, which is significantly smaller than in compacts like the Canon S95.So, off to Barbados and into the water with the turtles. One immediate observation was that the display is very difficult to use at snorkelling depths \(where there may be quite a lot of ambient light from above\/behind you\), and the tiny font becomes illegible for a user like me with ageing eyes. A \"high contrast\" option on the display, and a large\-font \"quick menu\" option \(like on all my Canon and Panasonic cameras\) would be useful.However, a few minutes into the snorkelling session I noticed a much more serious problem\: the camera kept on switching itself off, and the battery level was dropping almost as I watched. I managed to snatch a couple of shots, but the camera was really misbehaving, and I had to give up.Back on the boat the problem was immediately apparent \- the camera had sprung a leak presumably through the cover for the USB port, as that had evidence of water inside it. However, instead of being limited just to the port section, the water had spread rapidly through the camera with the result that the lens was misting up and the electrical problems were getting rapidly worse. Although I tried drying the camera out and recharging it, it\'s now completely dead. Fortunately I had invested in a waterproof SD card, so I managed to rescue a few decent shots, but otherwise it\'s a write\-off.This is an extremely poor design. As you have to charge the battery in camera \(using the proprietary USB cable \- another peeve\), there\'s no option of just sealing the camera for a complete trip. You would also think that the camera would have some measure of \"double sealing\" so that in the event of a leak into the port or battery\/card openings the water wouldn\'t permeate quickly into the rest of the electronics, but this is clearly not the case.This camera is completely inadequate for its intended use. Fortunately my suppliers \(the excellent Wex Photographic\) have promised me a full refund. I will not be spending it on Olympus equipment.", negetive

I bought it mainly as a travel camera and because it is waterprrof, freeze proof, drop proof, dust proof etc. It takes pretty good pictures.There is a major problem with the sound recording. There is a constant hum and it grinds, pings, beeps and makes mini jack hammer sounds when it tries to auto focus. The sounds are more than noticable when the video is played back. It also makes a loud buzzing noise when you zoom in and out.These sound issues make the video basically worthless on this camera.If olympus fixes these sound issues than this would be the perfect travel camera. In its current state it definitely is not", negetive
"When using this overpriced paperweight, I found that it was very easy and common to inadvertently put your left finger over the stereo microphones on the top completely trashing the sound for your video.  If you zoom in or out while taking a video, an unbelievably load motor whine is recorded and heard on the video when it is played back.  Even after the zoom stops, there are still strange electronic noises that linger in your video for maybe 3 or 4 seconds.  The still pictures had a strange orange fuzzy hue...no matter what I tried, I could not make them any sharper or clearer.", negetive
"Well, the fast lens is nice but it\'s not the only f\/2 waterproofer \(which a lot of people say it is\) \- the Pentax WG\-3 also has the f\/2 lens.Relative to every other waterproof compact I\'ve used \(Nikon aw100, Sony tx20 and Panasonic ts20\) it\'s really big and bulky. It\'s twice the price I bought any of the aforementioned waterproof compacts for and honestly, I would put the TG\-2 at the bottom of the pile in the IQ department \(by a big margin\). Noise reduction is terrible, yet high ISO shots look fairly reasonable \(most probably because of the NR\). This pretty much negates the lens in my opinion as it doesn\'t matter how good the lens is if every shot is going to have massive smudging noise reduction applied.Another thing I noticed is the loud zooming of the lens, especially in video, where as every other waterproofer I\'ve used has a virtually silent lens. \(No ticking though \- aka TG\-1 video\).LCD is nice.

Right out of the gate I noticed the pictures were not as sharp and while the camera shoots faster than the Nikon the images were useless.I was further disappointed with the TG\-2 when it fell out of my waders while I was taking them off. The camera fell only 2 feet to the ground but the force was enough to crack the video display. Needless to say I was unable to use the camera underwater after that.Very disappointed with this camera and I have since returned it.I look forward to getting my nikon back and trying some other cameras too.", negetive
"This is this camera but not the USA Model it is a gray market model.  I would rather have paid more money and got the model intended to be sold in the states.  I am disappointed with Amazon for allowing this vender to sell on there sight without give that information on the sight. In general I have been happy with Amazon, but they are slipping very fast.  This is the second item I received in the past three months that has not lived up to the write\-up.  Due to the fact that I bought it for my daughter to take on her trip I can not return it.", negetive
"this camera wouldn\'t even charge. I had to return it as there was a problem with the camera not getting power.  I think this is a junk.", negetive
"The \"Tough\" little Olympus TG\-2 iHS is pretty to look at, but it sits dead in front of me. Amazon\'s Pavillion Electronics sent a charger cable with a European style 3\-pronged plug, instead of a standard 2\-pronged plug. I live in Oregon, so someone at Pavillion goofed. You\'d think that Amazon Customer Service would have quickly and easily ordered the right cable and have it shipped to me overnight \(I need the camera as I type this\). Instead, I was on the phone with an Amazon rep for about an hour. Most of the time I was kept on\-hold. Finally, the rep said he would call me back. He didn\'t. Instead he sent a terse email, which said only this\: \"Thank you for contacting us.\" So on my own, I had to find a different Amazon Customer Service rep. Fortunately, I found a competent and very pleasant agent, who set up an order for a 2\-pronged plug, but from a different supplier. It\'s now in the middle of the next day, and the part hasn\'t been shipped yet. I just found out that it won\'t be shipped by the fastest carrier for overnight delivery in the morning. I paid for the \$18 replacement part, and then got an email saying it would be refunded on credit card. But the email said it was for a replacement 32 GB memory card, which I ordered with the camera. The memory card appears to be fine. I tried to email a reply to Amazon about the mistake, but my email was blocked.", negetive
"I bought this camera as a xmas gift.  we used it once and it stopped working.  After tryign to charge it via the wall charger that was sent with it and by plugging the cord into the back of my computer, the camera simply would not turn on.  I gave the camera as a gift on 12\/25 and tried to return it on Feb.3.  Beach camera told me that the return  policy was 30 days and they would not take back the non working  camera after 39 days.", negetive
"30 minutes into a family beach trip at Destin, Fl the camera stopped working.  It will not do anything and it has not gone underwater.  We are just outside our amazon return window so we are stuck contacting olympus.  regardless of warranty service we will have no pictures from this trip.", negetive
"As an all\-purpose camera, it is very poor.  Not enough zoom.  Will use it for snorkeling in 3 weeks.  Perhaps it will be good for that, but very disappointed so far.", negetive
"They refuse to take a no working unit back\!...They keep saying they have sent a return label but they haven\'t, they will not provide an address or phone number to reach them\! BUYER BEWARE\!", negetive
"Camera takes good pictures but it leaks water to inside the camera so lens gets foggy. Battery life is good.  Underwater pics are fair. Camera is overprice.", negetive
"Worked like a charm.  Used it for general and underwater photography in Hawaii.  Not too heavy or too big.easy to use.", negetive
"I have very disappointed with the quality of the pictures indoors.  It uses an ISO so high that the pictures come out very grainy.  I also don\'t like that it has lens cover so it immediately got junk on the lens.", negetive
"We used this camera for 12 days and we we\'re very satisfied with the quality of the pictures. The Dynamic mode makes great shots\! Unfortunately, once we used it in the water, after about 15 minutes in the water, air bubbles came out of the shutter button. The camera was garbage after this. Apparently water had somehow gotten into the camera and it would not work again. Everything was completely sealed which is why this surprised us. The next 2 days were spent trying to dry it out with a hair dryer, charging it and trying to power it on. Both of these attempts only heated up the camera which fogged everything up. The lens is spotted from the inside from all the water now. We were on vacation when this happened and returned it back to Best Buy at day 16. We luckily received store credit since it was 1 day over the return policy. Did we have a lemon\? Maybe, but we\'re not willing to chance it\! I\'ve read similar reviews on the TG\-2 but thougt \"it won\'t happen to us\!\". We\'ll probably go with the Pentax WG\-3 next which is identical according to the specs. Hopefully we\'ll have more luck with the Pentax.", negetive
"Does horribly when there\'s light...even if it\'s just street lights in the background.  It blurs when there\'s light and sometimes when there isn\'t.  The only you can do when it blurs is turn it off and on again, hoping this time it\'ll focus.  Also, the contrast is super high, making all your subjects super dark.  If you ever take a picture outside, regardless of whether or not it\'s a sunny or cloudy day, the camera will always focus on the sky and not your subject, meaning half your photo will be high resolution sky and half pitch black \(your subject\)My biggest gripe though, is that I\'ve only had it for four months and already it\'s malfunctioning.  Half the times when I turn it on, the shutter malfunctions and blocks the lens, thus making the screen dark.300 dollars is definitely not a reasonable upgrade from the 200 dollar TG\-820 which I loved so much.  I accidentally got that model ran over a car and yet it still worked for a couple more months.  I think I\'m going to go back to that camera.", negetive
"A nice gift \- but unfortunately, after 32 days \- a loud fast clicking noise can be heard coming from the camera audible to the human ear and thus recorded on any video taken.  Missed the 30 days return with Amazon \:\(.  Most likely this camera out of 1000\'s has a defect \- otherwise a good camera I think.", negetive
"I just unpacked my TG\-2 and was very disheartened to see multiple cables \& cords. I bought the camera because it\'s highly rated for low light situations and is water\/dust\-proof and shock resistant. If it performs as advertised, I will be happy to upgrade my rating. But for now, I\'m most unhappy with the rigmarole for charging the battery. The battery charges inside the camera and you must connect the camera to the battery charger via USB cable and then connect the charger to the USB\-AC adapter. All are proprietary. So, what\'s the big deal\? Well, I\'m a frequent traveler and as all travelers know, the amount of crap we have haul around to keep our computers, notebooks, cameras, MP3 players, Kindles, phones, etc charged is absurd. The last thing I want in a new camera is three more pieces of auxiliary equipment to pack and track. My other cameras \(Canon and Panasonic\-\-this is my first Olympus\) have small chargers that plug directly into the power source. Is there a good reason why Olympus can\'t follow suit\? I realize it\'s a relatively minor matter, but it was enough that I seriously considered returning the camera.1\/26\/14 update\: I bought spare batteries and a plug\-in charger, so that problem is solved. However, I finally got around to charging and installing a battery \& the camera doesn\'t function. When the battery is inserted, the camera makes a grinding sound and the screen lights up but after a few seconds, it beeps several times and shuts itself off and then makes some more grinding sounds. Once the battery is installed, it won\'t turn on at all, just makes those grinding sounds. I\'ve tried all three batteries. The rating goes down accordingly to one star.", negetive
"I\'m really disappointed in my TG\-1. I just mailed it out to El Paso, TX this afternoon for warranty repair. I\'m completely bummed... Summer is short in Minnesota and will not have my camera for use for my summer fun activities I purchased it for. I have only used it a few times and was on vacation with my family in San Diego when the back buttons stopped working. I have sent a letter via certified mail to explain my frustrations with Olympus and this model... I\'m not the first customer to take their camera to the beach and then realize that the back buttons no longer work. No menus... no videos... nothing. I think this is a great camera, just don\'t get it wet, and make sure you have a backup camera for when this one falls apart or stops working.", negetive
"DO NOT BUY \- Not A Good Product.I bought my TG2 on Monday, September 23, 2013. Except for testing at home have tried to use it on my trip last week. It shot the first couple of photos fine and then the zoom stopped working. It would zoom but was totally out of focus and the green focus lock would not come. If I took the photo it was still out of focus.  I restarted \& shot a photo without zooming, but as soon as I zoomed, no matter how little I zoomed, everything went out of focus. I tried restarting, reset from menu, different SD card \- NOTHING HELPS\!\!  I tried several shooting modes with no sign of improvements. Issue is intermittent. It works for few photos using zoom with no problems but after that any use of zoom lever resulting in out of focus.  Tried to contact Olympus through email \- it doesnt work either. Unfortunately as an apparently intermittent problem, if I send it Olympus for service it may probably work for them. I am trying to contact Olympus in all possible ways.", negetive
"I make my living as a photographer and use the highest\-end gear on a daily basis.  I have wanted a waterproof camera for years, and so I decided to start reading reviews online...  Many of them pointed to the Tough TG\-2 as a \'best\-in\-class\' point and shoot.  I have never liked Olympus\' products, so I was a bit leery, but after such across\-the\-board high marks, I decided to give it a shot.Upon my first time out with the camera, I immediately noticed a couple issues \- the first was ergonomic, the other was image quality.Ergonomics \- command dial very stiff to turn, especially with wet hands.  The arrow pad is located too close to the command dial and ends up requiring you to almost click with your fingernail instead of fingertip to make selections...  Just kind of put me off.The \#1 reason to avoid this camera is POOR IMAGE QUALITY.  With technology being what it is today, you should NOT look at a full sized image, shot at the lowest ISO \(100\) and see pixelation.  These files are super pixel\-y, even at ISO100.  Now granted, I am used to using very nice cameras, but nevertheless, IF YOU CARE ABOUT IMAGE QUALITY and printing, avoid this camera. Trust me.If all you want to do are post snapshots to Facebook, etc, I\'m sure this will do the trick, but if you love photography and good images, find another model.Lastly, I had it yesterday in the ocean, third time I have used it.  I started getting fogging inside with everything sealed up properly...  Didn\'t notice till after I had made many blurry, out\-of\-focus pictures.  Really disappointed.  Going to try and return to Amazon \- hope I can still get my money back and put it towards something better.  I should have known better than to go with Olympus after seeing the poor quality of their pro gear in the past\!  Live and learn.", negetive
"Died on first use in the ocean during my honeymoon \(Fortunately, I had the foresight to bring multiple camera but only one waterproof one\).  As far as I can tell, the water leaked in through the mode dial.  Some really fine sand made it\'s way in there \(I could here grinding\) and probably breached the seal.  The battery\/SD card compartment was bone dry when I checked.  I tested it multiple times in the sink to ensure it would work in the water which is why I\'m convinced it\'s related to the sand.A weather proof \/ underwater camera that can\'t handle a beach is utterly useless in my book.  I should have steered away when I saw others complain about this and foolishly thought it was user error.", negetive
"I bought this camera back in March when it first came out. I was looking for a durable underwater camera.Since March I have used it a handful of times and I am not impressed. I understand that when you choose an underwater camera you lose some quality. However, it takes horrible pictures whether you are underwater or not.Half of the time I haven\'t been able to use the camera because all it does is beep several times and shut off.I sent the camera away once and now I am sending it away a second time because I am still having the same issue.The technical support and customer service at Olympus is a headache. I can never reach someone that I can understand because they all have such strong accents. I finally found someone that I could make out what they were saying. No one answers your questions when you are on the phone with them. They are just silent. They always send me information on where to send it in the US when I am from Canada. It doesn\'t matter how many times I tell them I am from Canada I had to call back several times to get a shipping address in Canada.I was so excited about this camera and now I am disapointed. I spent a good chunk of money on this camera and can\'t use it. I was told that they would send me a refurbished camera if they try 3 times to fix it and it doesn\'t work. It\'s a brand new camera that has been barely used and the best they can do is a refurbished camera.PLEASE do not waste your money.", negetive
"Quality of the camera is very bad. We\'ve been using Canon camera w\/ 7.8Magapixel and 3.8X optical zoom since 2007, this camera is supposed to be an upgrade and come out to be much worse. The camera is always dead\/down \(like a computer doesn\'t have enough ram and become dead\) while we switch in modes or between modes, or even try to zoom in and out. The Direct Link botton is located right at the holding spot, so when holding the camera to take a picture, most of the time this botton is pressed without you knowing it. The touch screen is not sensitive at all, I keep touching it and no response come out, really hate it\!  The Picture qualilty is so so, even with a much larger resolution, the quality is no better than my 2007 Canon camera. I have samsung phone and headphone and like them, and that\'s why I want to trust the same brand, but it is a really disappointed product.", negetive
"Idid not have any luck with this camera and I depended on it when I went to Europe. It did not fuction properly for a new camera.", negetive
"We took it to a long trip abroad. For few times the zoom lens got stuck, but we managed to release it by following the suggestion on the screen \(shut it down, take out the battery and reinsert\). But then came the time, in the middle of our trip, that it got stuck and refused to get back to normal operation for several days. Then all of a sudden it is ok again. In short, completely unreliable camera\! I wish I could return it but too much time passed, due to the length of our trip. I contacted Samsung and they were unwilling to replace it with a new camera. This is much for a service...", negetive
"Where to start\? Truly if there were minus stars this would be a good time to use them. Clumsy lay out ugly piece of plastic looks like it came freshly printed out of a cheap 3\-D printer. Underlined by a plastic bullet screw mount that surely won\'t survive more than a couple of weeks.  Horrible image quality barely living up to the camera of a high class smart phone, flat washed out colours, mostly overexposed and almost never sharp. The highly praised WiFi capability is very slow often not working at all and to make matters worse every time you want to use it, lose the connection \(happens about every five minutes\) or simply have closed the app and want to go into it again you have to go through the entire cumbersome connection process. I promise you will be so happy that the camera came with a USB cable to use instead. You are much better of, infect it works twice as good, to buy yourself a WiFi SD card.If you still can\'t help yourself and really have to buy this camera at least choose it in white you may be lucky leaving it on your fridge one day to never see it again and if you belong to the unlucky ones like me that bought that piece of \*\#\$\$ already just use it as a sinker on your next fishing trip.", negetive
"I bought this camera to take on a once in a lifetime trip around the world and it broke within 3 months\!Now I can\'t click to return it via Amazon because it\'s past the return, there doesn\'t seem to be anyone I can email regarding this faulty product. Its TERRIBLE customer service and the LAST time I will buy from Amazon.I was so sad, I was in India with the most incredible opportunities to take photos, a chance I will never have again and this NEW camera broke.Please can someone contact me to help me and try and fix the huge inconvenience this caused.", negetive

"I got this camera 3 weeks ago and ended up returning it. It\'s the biggest piece of junk I\'ve ever owned. I have used a dslr canon rebel for the last 5 years and just wanted a good point and shoot on the side. The quality of the pictures \(although decent looking on the camera screen\) is absolutely terrible when viewed on a computer. And though the camera does have lots of different options it really doesn\'t matter when most pictures taken are blurry, out of focus and just plain bad..I went back to Best Buy and got a Nikon COOLPIX S9500 and I am much happier with the quality. Quite honestly other than owning a dslr it is the best quality I\'ve had experience with so far.", negetive
"I purchased this camera from Best Buy... it\'s price was decent, and I like Samsung stuff.Now, after using it in the real world, I\'ve decided this was not the best camera I could have gotten for the money.Disappointments\:1. While the camera has lots of cool wifi features, they are clunky to use.2. Overall the intuitive feel for just taking pictures is non\-existent. It feels like some engineer in a cubicle who never gets out designed the menu and control systems. This is my most hated aspect of the unit.3. Picture quality for a camera of this resolution is overall lackluster. Colors are bland, even when you tinker in menu.4. The resolution and end product seems that of a far cheaper camera.5. Long zoom is nice, but crappy optics with lots of distortion, coupled with a presumably horrible image sensor turn out picturs of things nice and close up, but horrible color, focus, and quality.6. Did I mention the menu ergonomics\? UGH\!7. Connectivity\: I use EyeFi cards in all of my digital cameras... love the ease and speed and being able to copy videos and stills to my PC for archiving. The WB250F has BUILT IN connectivity, for backing up to your network \(KLUDGEY\) and to online services, such as Evernote, FB Youtube and SkyDrive \(Microsoft\) I have tried Samsung\'s \"AutoBackup\" that\'s built in, and it works, but it\'s MANUAL\! I have to go into a menu on the camera and \'do it\'. This is insane.Lastly, and this is VERY IMPORTANT\: One of the connectivity features available to the user in the WiFi menu is Skydrive, as I mentioned.I have a Microsoft account, so I thought \'hey\! I can use this, at least\! It will backup my pictures to a folder in my Skydrive\! Cool\!Well, I set it all up, and once again \(you have to\) went in Manually and selected the pictures and Videos to upload... WHAT\?\?\?\? IT DOES NOT LET YOU UPLOAD VIDEOS\!\!\!\! This is RETARDED. Ok, so let\'s at least backup my stills.So, I manually selected a bunch of pictures and uploaded them. It worked, pretty fast too.. when it was done, I almost deleted those images \(irreplaceable ones\) from my SD card, but hesitated for some reason. From my PC, I checked in my SkyDrive folder,verified that the images had properly copied, and then chose to view some of them. um... wait, something isn\'t right here OMG\>\>  ... YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.... SAMSUNG DOES NOT BACKUP THE ORIGINAL SIZE AND RESOLUTION OF YOUR PICTURES. THEY SHRINK THEM TO 1600X1200 FROM THE NATIVE 4320X3240  AND GET THIS\:  \-\-  THEY  \-\-\-  DON\'T  \-\-\-  TELL  \-\-\-  YOU  \-\-\-  THIS  \-\-\-  ANYWHERE\!\!\!\!\!This is PREPOSTEROUS.Furthermore, you cannot, to my knowledge CHANGE THIS SETTING in any menu, I\'ve searched.So you\'re on a trip, take a bazillion pics. Your SD card is full so you upload everything to your SkyDrive. Great\! DONE\!\!\!\! yay\! You erase the card and take more pictures. Get home, look at them, zoom in ONCE and suddenly you see HEAVY pixelation... gasp... so then you double\-check all of them, they are all the same... and then SCREAM OUT LOUD multiple bad words directed at the moronic GEEK engineers at Samsung.Holy crap, this is a HUGE deal. And it\'s not mentioned ANYWHERE in the menu system, docs, etc.This is completely unacceptable.BEWARE of THIS CRAPPY CAMERA.", negetive
"Bought this for my vacation to Europe.  On day 3, the zoom lens was stacked and can\'t use the camera at all.  Called Samsung tech support when I got back from vacation but tech support cannot help, saying that the serial number doesn\'t exist.  Weeks later, I got an email from Samsung tech support, asking for serial number again.  I responded to the email but I did not hear back from Samsung ever again.  It\'s been 6 months. What a rip\-off.  I ordered this camera through Amazon.com and was shipped from Beach Camera.  Will not buy any camera from amazon.com, never again.", negetive

Maybe a firmware upgrade will fix this. I\'m returning the camera.", negetive
