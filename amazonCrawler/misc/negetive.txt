"WASTE OF MONEYWhat a crappy camera. The worse part of the camera is the audio on the movies. It\'s absolutely ridiculous that this is an issue. You\'d think it would be a simply software fix but this is crazy. The TG\-1 had the same problem and it\'s not being fixed. I guess this is what you get when you buy NON USA.The quality of the image is really not that good unless the lighting is amazing.", negetive
"There\'s a salutory lesson here about not jumping to premature conclusions. Based on my first impressions of this camera I had mentally started drafting a review based on praising the hardware, but with some criticism of the software and firmware. I even had a great tag line\: \"A camera for adventurers who want a few pictures, rather than photographers who want adventures\". That was before the snorkelling trip...For many years now if there\'s been the prospect of either snorkelling or diving on holiday I\'ve taken a Canon PowerShot S\-series or G\-series camera with its waterproof housing. I\'ve had at least three generations of that solution, which have been utterly reliable and produced some good results. However they are a bulky solution in these days of reducing baggage allowances, and somewhat slow and clumsy in operation.This year, therefore, I decided to try a different solution, and opted after some deliberation for one of the new \"ultra tough compacts\". While Canon and Panasonic both have a comparable solution, after some deliberation I went for the Olympus TG2, based on a combination of its looks and spec.This is supposedly a very tough piece of kit \- waterproof to 15m, drop\-proof to 2m, crush\-proof to 100kg and with a large operating temperature range. The downside is that this is a market where the competition is intense but based on point for point feature matching, with a focus on improving things like nominal depth protection rather than the photographic features.That meant that even before use in anger there were some compromises\: none of the cameras in this class do RAW, even though Canon, for example, support this fully on their smaller high\-end compacts like the S95. to make things worse the TG2 also lacks many of the some other fundamental tools to control exposure such as automatic bracketing \(despite a very high frame rate which would support it well\), or shutter priority.The lack of these features is a complete mystery to me, when these cameras are allegedly designed to be used in conditions where the lighting as well as the environment will be challenging...Early trials did suggested that the camera does have accurate, fast autofocus \(which was something I particularly wanted\), and makes a decent job of auto exposure in most cases. Picture quality is OK, but the noise levels rise rapidly at ISO 800 and above, the JPEGs have a somewhat \"overprocessed\" look, and there\'s some noticeable pincushion distortion on underwater shots, even at medium zoom. These are presumably all  the result of the tiny sensor, which is significantly smaller than in compacts like the Canon S95.So, off to Barbados and into the water with the turtles. One immediate observation was that the display is very difficult to use at snorkelling depths \(where there may be quite a lot of ambient light from above\/behind you\), and the tiny font becomes illegible for a user like me with ageing eyes. A \"high contrast\" option on the display, and a large\-font \"quick menu\" option \(like on all my Canon and Panasonic cameras\) would be useful.However, a few minutes into the snorkelling session I noticed a much more serious problem\: the camera kept on switching itself off, and the battery level was dropping almost as I watched. I managed to snatch a couple of shots, but the camera was really misbehaving, and I had to give up.Back on the boat the problem was immediately apparent \- the camera had sprung a leak presumably through the cover for the USB port, as that had evidence of water inside it. However, instead of being limited just to the port section, the water had spread rapidly through the camera with the result that the lens was misting up and the electrical problems were getting rapidly worse. Although I tried drying the camera out and recharging it, it\'s now completely dead. Fortunately I had invested in a waterproof SD card, so I managed to rescue a few decent shots, but otherwise it\'s a write\-off.This is an extremely poor design. As you have to charge the battery in camera \(using the proprietary USB cable \- another peeve\), there\'s no option of just sealing the camera for a complete trip. You would also think that the camera would have some measure of \"double sealing\" so that in the event of a leak into the port or battery\/card openings the water wouldn\'t permeate quickly into the rest of the electronics, but this is clearly not the case.This camera is completely inadequate for its intended use. Fortunately my suppliers \(the excellent Wex Photographic\) have promised me a full refund. I will not be spending it on Olympus equipment.", negetive
"I\'m sure the TG2 is a good product\; but the TG2 I rec\'d would not work, right out of the box\! The monitor would not light up. All it did was show printed info. You couldn\'t take a picture, use the telefoto lens, use the menu, etc.  Unfortunately, I didn\'t attempt to use the camera until a month after I rec\'d it from Amazon\; and so I couldn\'t send it back to Amazon for replacement. I had to send it Oympus, instead, under the warranty. I hope they can repair or replace it for me.  I feel foolish for not testing the camera right away upon its arrival\; but we wanted to wait for our anniversary before we used it.", negetive
"Olympus pulled a boner with this camera and it\'s predecessor the TG 1.  Both cameras take excellent photos and have lots of neat shooting modes, but don\'t expect anything from the Video.  All video production \(except the underwater mode\) will come through with a horrible ticking noise.  Turns out it is the auto focus.  Olympus says it\'s normal and will not honor any return for this reason.  Idiots\!", negetive
"I wanted to like this camera. I bought it mainly as a travel camera and because it is waterprrof, freeze proof, drop proof, dust proof etc. It takes pretty good pictures.There is a major problem with the sound recording. There is a constant hum and it grinds, pings, beeps and makes mini jack hammer sounds when it tries to auto focus. The sounds are more than noticable when the video is played back. It also makes a loud buzzing noise when you zoom in and out.These sound issues make the video basically worthless on this camera.If olympus fixes these sound issues than this would be the perfect travel camera. In its current state it definitely is not", negetive
"When using this overpriced paperweight, I found that it was very easy and common to inadvertently put your left finger over the stereo microphones on the top completely trashing the sound for your video.  If you zoom in or out while taking a video, an unbelievably load motor whine is recorded and heard on the video when it is played back.  Even after the zoom stops, there are still strange electronic noises that linger in your video for maybe 3 or 4 seconds.  The still pictures had a strange orange fuzzy hue...no matter what I tried, I could not make them any sharper or clearer.", negetive
"Well, the fast lens is nice but it\'s not the only f\/2 waterproofer \(which a lot of people say it is\) \- the Pentax WG\-3 also has the f\/2 lens.Relative to every other waterproof compact I\'ve used \(Nikon aw100, Sony tx20 and Panasonic ts20\) it\'s really big and bulky. It\'s twice the price I bought any of the aforementioned waterproof compacts for and honestly, I would put the TG\-2 at the bottom of the pile in the IQ department \(by a big margin\). Noise reduction is terrible, yet high ISO shots look fairly reasonable \(most probably because of the NR\). This pretty much negates the lens in my opinion as it doesn\'t matter how good the lens is if every shot is going to have massive smudging noise reduction applied.Another thing I noticed is the loud zooming of the lens, especially in video, where as every other waterproofer I\'ve used has a virtually silent lens. \(No ticking though \- aka TG\-1 video\).LCD is nice. Camera looks great. I returned it. No way worth the money compared to cameras half the price or less out there right now. I am going to give it a one star ...thinking about a two star, but honestly, too much money, look elsewhere.", negetive
"Super Unhappy\! Received my camera today and it won\'t turn on. No indicator light, no screen, nothing.I hope this doesn\'t happen to a lot of people.", negetive
"I have been shooting with a Nikon AW100 for the last 2 years. Recently the AW100 was damaged and went in for repair. In the meantime I wanted to try something else. I picked up the TG\-2 in time for a fishing trip to michigan. Right out of the gate I noticed the pictures were not as sharp and while the camera shoots faster than the Nikon the images were useless.I was further disappointed with the TG\-2 when it fell out of my waders while I was taking them off. The camera fell only 2 feet to the ground but the force was enough to crack the video display. Needless to say I was unable to use the camera underwater after that.Very disappointed with this camera and I have since returned it.I look forward to getting my nikon back and trying some other cameras too.", negetive
"This is this camera but not the USA Model it is a gray market model.  I would rather have paid more money and got the model intended to be sold in the states.  I am disappointed with Amazon for allowing this vender to sell on there sight without give that information on the sight. In general I have been happy with Amazon, but they are slipping very fast.  This is the second item I received in the past three months that has not lived up to the write\-up.  Due to the fact that I bought it for my daughter to take on her trip I can not return it.", negetive

"The \"Tough\" little Olympus TG\-2 iHS is pretty to look at, but it sits dead in front of me. Amazon\'s Pavillion Electronics sent a charger cable with a European style 3\-pronged plug, instead of a standard 2\-pronged plug. I live in Oregon, so someone at Pavillion goofed. You\'d think that Amazon Customer Service would have quickly and easily ordered the right cable and have it shipped to me overnight \(I need the camera as I type this\). Instead, I was on the phone with an Amazon rep for about an hour. Most of the time I was kept on\-hold. Finally, the rep said he would call me back. He didn\'t. Instead he sent a terse email, which said only this\: \"Thank you for contacting us.\" So on my own, I had to find a different Amazon Customer Service rep. Fortunately, I found a competent and very pleasant agent, who set up an order for a 2\-pronged plug, but from a different supplier. It\'s now in the middle of the next day, and the part hasn\'t been shipped yet. I just found out that it won\'t be shipped by the fastest carrier for overnight delivery in the morning. I paid for the \$18 replacement part, and then got an email saying it would be refunded on credit card. But the email said it was for a replacement 32 GB memory card, which I ordered with the camera. The memory card appears to be fine. I tried to email a reply to Amazon about the mistake, but my email was blocked.", negetive
"I bought this camera as a xmas gift.  we used it once and it stopped working.

"We used this camera for 12 days and we we\'re very satisfied with the quality of the pictures. The Dynamic mode makes great shots\! Unfortunately, once we used it in the water, after about 15 minutes in the water, air bubbles came out of the shutter button. The camera was garbage after this. Apparently water had somehow gotten into the camera and it would not work again. Everything was completely sealed which is why this surprised us. The next 2 days were spent trying to dry it out with a hair dryer, charging it and trying to power it on. Both of these attempts only heated up the camera which fogged everything up. The lens is spotted from the inside from all the water now. We were on vacation when this happened and returned it back to Best Buy at day 16. We luckily received store credit since it was 1 day over the return policy. Did we have a lemon\? Maybe, but we\'re not willing to chance it\! I\'ve read similar reviews on the TG\-2 but thougt \"it won\'t happen to us\!\". We\'ll probably go with the Pentax WG\-3 next which is identical according to the specs. Hopefully we\'ll have more luck with the Pentax.", negetive
"Does horribly when there\'s light...even if it\'s just street lights in the background.  It blurs when there\'s light and sometimes when there isn\'t.  The only you can do when it blurs is turn it off and on again, hoping this time it\'ll focus.  Also, the contrast is super high, making all your subjects super dark.  If you ever take a picture outside, regardless of whether or not it\'s a sunny or cloudy day, the camera will always focus on the sky and not your subject, meaning half your photo will be high resolution sky and half pitch black \(your subject\)My biggest gripe though, is that I\'ve only had it for four months and already it\'s malfunctioning.  Half the times when I turn it on, the shutter malfunctions and blocks the lens, thus making the screen dark.300 dollars is definitely not a reasonable upgrade from the 200 dollar TG\-820 which I loved so much.  I accidentally got that model ran over a car and yet it still worked for a couple more months.  I think I\'m going to go back to that camera.", negetive
"A nice gift \- but unfortunately, after 32 days \- a loud fast clicking noise can be heard coming from the camera audible to the human ear and thus recorded on any video taken.

"I just unpacked my TG\-2 and was very disheartened to see multiple cables \& cords. I bought the camera because it\'s highly rated for low light situations and is water\/dust\-proof and shock resistant. If it performs as advertised, I will be happy to upgrade my rating. But for now, I\'m most unhappy with the rigmarole for charging the battery. The battery charges inside the camera and you must connect the camera to the battery charger via USB cable and then connect the charger to the USB\-AC adapter. All are proprietary. So, what\'s the big deal\? Well, I\'m a frequent traveler and as all travelers know, the amount of crap we have haul around to keep our computers, notebooks, cameras, MP3 players, Kindles, phones, etc charged is absurd. The last thing I want in a new camera is three more pieces of auxiliary equipment to pack and track. My other cameras \(Canon and Panasonic\-\-this is my first Olympus\) have small chargers that plug directly into the power source. Is there a good reason why Olympus can\'t follow suit\? I realize it\'s a relatively minor matter, but it was enough that I seriously considered returning the camera.1\/26\/14 update\: I bought spare batteries and a plug\-in charger, so that problem is solved. However, I finally got around to charging and installing a battery \& the camera doesn\'t function. When the battery is inserted, the camera makes a grinding sound and the screen lights up but after a few seconds, it beeps several times and shuts itself off and then makes some more grinding sounds. Once the battery is installed, it won\'t turn on at all, just makes those grinding sounds. I\'ve tried all three batteries. The rating goes down accordingly to one star.", negetive
"I\'m really disappointed in my TG\-1. I just mailed it out to El Paso, TX this afternoon for warranty repair. I\'m completely bummed... Summer is short in Minnesota and will not have my camera for use for my summer fun activities I purchased it for. I have only used it a few times and was on vacation with my family in San Diego when the back buttons stopped working. I have sent a letter via certified mail to explain my frustrations with Olympus and this model... I\'m not the first customer to take their camera to the beach and then realize that the back buttons no longer work. No menus... no videos... nothing. I think this is a great camera, just don\'t get it wet, and make sure you have a backup camera for when this one falls apart or stops working.", negetive
"DO NOT BUY \- Not A Good Product.I bought my TG2 on Monday, September 23, 2013. Except for testing at home have tried to use it on my trip last week. It shot the first couple of photos fine and then the zoom stopped working. It would zoom but was totally out of focus and the green focus lock would not come. If I took the photo it was still out of focus.  I restarted \& shot a photo without zooming, but as soon as I zoomed, no matter how little I zoomed, everything went out of focus. I tried restarting, reset from menu, different SD card \- NOTHING HELPS\!\!  I tried several shooting modes with no sign of improvements. Issue is intermittent. It works for few photos using zoom with no problems but after that any use of zoom lever resulting in out of focus.  Tried to contact Olympus through email \- it doesnt work either. Unfortunately as an apparently intermittent problem, if I send it Olympus for service it may probably work for them. I am trying to contact Olympus in all possible ways.", negetive
"I make my living as a photographer and use the highest\-end gear on a daily basis.  I have wanted a waterproof camera for years, and so I decided to start reading reviews online...  Many of them pointed to the Tough TG\-2 as a \'best\-in\-class\' point and shoot.  I have never liked Olympus\' products, so I was a bit leery, but after such across\-the\-board high marks, I decided to give it a shot.Upon my first time out with the camera, I immediately noticed a couple issues \- the first was ergonomic, the other was image quality.Ergonomics \- command dial very stiff to turn, especially with wet hands.  The arrow pad is located too close to the command dial and ends up requiring you to almost click with your fingernail instead of fingertip to make selections...  Just kind of put me off.The \#1 reason to avoid this camera is POOR IMAGE QUALITY.  With technology being what it is today, you should NOT look at a full sized image, shot at the lowest ISO \(100\) and see pixelation.  These files are super pixel\-y, even at ISO100.  Now granted, I am used to using very nice cameras, but nevertheless, IF YOU CARE ABOUT IMAGE QUALITY and printing, avoid this camera. Trust me.If all you want to do are post snapshots to Facebook, etc, I\'m sure this will do the trick, but if you love photography and good images, find another model.Lastly, I had it yesterday in the ocean, third time I have used it.  I started getting fogging inside with everything sealed up properly...  Didn\'t notice till after I had made many blurry, out\-of\-focus pictures.  Really disappointed.  Going to try and return to Amazon \- hope I can still get my money back and put it towards something better.  I should have known better than to go with Olympus after seeing the poor quality of their pro gear in the past\!  Live and learn.", negetive
"Died on first use in the ocean during my honeymoon \(Fortunately, I had the foresight to bring multiple camera but only one waterproof one\).  As far as I can tell, the water leaked in through the mode dial.  Some really fine sand made it\'s way in there \(I could here grinding\) and probably breached the seal.  The battery\/SD card compartment was bone dry when I checked.  I tested it multiple times in the sink to ensure it would work in the water which is why I\'m convinced it\'s related to the sand.A weather proof \/ underwater camera that can\'t handle a beach is utterly useless in my book.  I should have steered away when I saw others complain about this and foolishly thought it was user error.", negetive
"I bought this camera back in March when it first came out. I was looking for a durable underwater camera.Since March I have used it a handful of times and I am not impressed. I understand that when you choose an underwater camera you lose some quality. However, it takes horrible pictures whether you are underwater or not.Half of the time I haven\'t been able to use the camera because all it does is beep several times and shut off.I sent the camera away once and now I am sending it away a second time because I am still having the same issue.The technical support and customer service at Olympus is a headache. I can never reach someone that I can understand because they all have such strong accents. I finally found someone that I could make out what they were saying. No one answers your questions when you are on the phone with them. They are just silent. They always send me information on where to send it in the US when I am from Canada. It doesn\'t matter how many times I tell them I am from Canada I had to call back several times to get a shipping address in Canada.I was so excited about this camera and now I am disapointed. I spent a good chunk of money on this camera and can\'t use it. I was told that they would send me a refurbished camera if they try 3 times to fix it and it doesn\'t work. It\'s a brand new camera that has been barely used and the best they can do is a refurbished camera.PLEASE do not waste your money.", negetive
"Quality of the camera is very bad. We\'ve been using Canon camera w\/ 7.8Magapixel and 3.8X optical zoom since 2007, this camera is supposed to be an upgrade and come out to be much worse. The camera is always dead\/down \(like a computer doesn\'t have enough ram and become dead\) while we switch in modes or between modes, or even try to zoom in and out. The Direct Link botton is located right at the holding spot, so when holding the camera to take a picture, most of the time this botton is pressed without you knowing it. The touch screen is not sensitive at all, I keep touching it and no response come out, really hate it\!  The Picture qualilty is so so, even with a much larger resolution, the quality is no better than my 2007 Canon camera. I have samsung phone and headphone and like them, and that\'s why I want to trust the same brand, but it is a really disappointed product.", negetive

Horrible image quality barely living up to the camera of a high class smart phone, flat washed out colours, mostly overexposed and almost never sharp. The highly praised WiFi capability is very slow often not working at all and to make matters worse every time you want to use it, lose the connection \(happens about every five minutes\) or simply have closed the app and want to go into it again you have to go through the entire cumbersome connection process. I promise you will be so happy that the camera came with a USB cable to use instead. You are much better of, infect it works twice as good, to buy yourself a WiFi SD card.If you still can\'t help yourself and really have to buy this camera at least choose it in white you may be lucky leaving it on your fridge one day to never see it again and if you belong to the unlucky ones like me that bought that piece of \*\#\$\$ already just use it as a sinker on your next fishing trip.", negetive

"I purchased this camera from Best Buy... it\'s price was decent, and I like Samsung stuff.Now, after using it in the real world, I\'ve decided this was not the best camera I could have gotten for the money.Disappointments\:1. While the camera has lots of cool wifi features, they are clunky to use.2. Overall the intuitive feel for just taking pictures is non\-existent. It feels like some engineer in a cubicle who never gets out designed the menu and control systems. This is my most hated aspect of the unit.3. Picture quality for a camera of this resolution is overall lackluster. Colors are bland, even when you tinker in menu.4. The resolution and end product seems that of a far cheaper camera.5. Long zoom is nice, but crappy optics with lots of distortion, coupled with a presumably horrible image sensor turn out picturs of things nice and close up, but horrible color, focus, and quality.6. Did I mention the menu ergonomics\? UGH\!7. Connectivity\: I use EyeFi cards in all of my digital cameras... love the ease and speed and being able to copy videos and stills to my PC for archiving. The WB250F has BUILT IN connectivity, for backing up to your network \(KLUDGEY\) and to online services, such as Evernote, FB Youtube and SkyDrive \(Microsoft\) I have tried Samsung\'s \"AutoBackup\" that\'s built in, and it works, but it\'s MANUAL\! I have to go into a menu on the camera and \'do it\'. This is insane.Lastly, and this is VERY IMPORTANT\: One of the connectivity features available to the user in the WiFi menu is Skydrive, as I mentioned.I have a Microsoft account, so I thought \'hey\! I can use this, at least\! It will backup my pictures to a folder in my Skydrive\! Cool\!Well, I set it all up, and once again \(you have to\) went in Manually and selected the pictures and Videos to upload... WHAT\?\?\?\? IT DOES NOT LET YOU UPLOAD VIDEOS\!\!\!\! This is RETARDED. Ok, so let\'s at least backup my stills.So, I manually selected a bunch of pictures and uploaded them. It worked, pretty fast too.. when it was done, I almost deleted those images \(irreplaceable ones\) from my SD card, but hesitated for some reason. From my PC, I checked in my SkyDrive folder,verified that the images had properly copied, and then chose to view some of them. um... wait, something isn\'t right here OMG\>\>  ... YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.... SAMSUNG DOES NOT BACKUP THE ORIGINAL SIZE AND RESOLUTION OF YOUR PICTURES. THEY SHRINK THEM TO 1600X1200 FROM THE NATIVE 4320X3240  AND GET THIS\:  \-\-  THEY  \-\-\-  DON\'T  \-\-\-  TELL  \-\-\-  YOU  \-\-\-  THIS  \-\-\-  ANYWHERE\!\!\!\!\!This is PREPOSTEROUS.Furthermore, you cannot, to my knowledge CHANGE THIS SETTING in any menu, I\'ve searched.So you\'re on a trip, take a bazillion pics. Your SD card is full so you upload everything to your SkyDrive. Great\! DONE\!\!\!\! yay\! You erase the card and take more pictures. Get home, look at them, zoom in ONCE and suddenly you see HEAVY pixelation... gasp... so then you double\-check all of them, they are all the same... and then SCREAM OUT LOUD multiple bad words directed at the moronic GEEK engineers at Samsung.Holy crap, this is a HUGE deal. And it\'s not mentioned ANYWHERE in the menu system, docs, etc.This is completely unacceptable.BEWARE of THIS CRAPPY CAMERA.", negetive
