2014-03-18 13:26:01-0300 [scrapy] INFO: A2500 replaced a more expensive Canon I got through Amex rewards. While traveling on the train or on the street in Manhattan I lost it.. It was very sleek and slippery LOL  Time went by, I found the need to have a camera beyong iphone, ipad. I ordered this camera and I am learning how to use it.What I have found is that I need to learn about: no blur, MACRO (close up) --for novices like me. I need  wide lens features and the ability to fade out unwanted subject in the background.. I have not learned how to use all the features. I have taken very nice shots and not so nice shots experimenting. I find that sharpness is something to be explored in the manual. I am sure Canon tries to keep cost down by not providing a printed out manual but I wanted one and I did the unthinkable:-- printed it out! put it in a three ring  binder! old school I guess! I can point and shoot as described in the product section of this listing. This camera is a nicely priced one and If I should get careless again only this time drive over it!, well it won't cost me an arm and a leg to replace!.. The manual consists of 109  pages! That means there is a lot to learn! I went to manual websites to see how much a manual would cost to buy. The manual service charges between $12.95 plus the shipping cost! and up.I had the typing paper and the ink so I printed it out!Hope this helps you! I am already researching another Canon digital 16 mega because I need close ups of moving animals! i.e. parrots! I would add I bought a .99cent cable UBS cord (reviewed) and two extra batteries from Clearmax and an extra battery recharger. The clearmax battery charges in one hour. The Canon battery that came with this camera charges in 21/2 hours. I bought a SD HC device/card 16GB.  Remember: the SDHC card DOES NOT come with the camera. I am going to get a case and more accessories for my camera. Hope this helps!  from a newbie

Just set it to program and choose the settings that you think will make the picture look good, your intuition is probably better than the cameras. Turn on the grid, so that you can easily find the center of a photograph. I take a lot of outdoors pictures and I really like the way they turn out.

I was looking for a camera to purchase for my  boyfriend as a gift and came across this. He absolutely loves it. The photographs are crisp and clear, and the stabilizer is the best I've seen in any other point and shoot camera. I highly recommend this to everyone.

2014-03-18 13:26:02-0300 [scrapy] INFO: I got this camera as my old Powershot broke and I needed to replace it. This one is better. I love the fact it is lightweight and slimmer than my old one. I think it takes better pictures than the old camera. I also love the improved feature of just hitting a button to go into movie mode. So for the money it is a great deal and I am really enjoying taking pictures with this camera.

I had a much more advanced digital camera for several years, and I could never quite get the hang of it.  Too many settings and options for me.This arrived earlier today, and the battery charged very quickly using the included charger.  I was able to use the camera immediately, and the photo quality was really quite good.  I took pictures in some different lighting, including one right in front of a window, and they all looked great.This might not be a camera for everyone, but it's perfect for what I wanted.

2014-03-18 13:26:02-0300 [scrapy] INFO: I needed a small little camera to carry around in my pocket and this camera filled the bill just right.  I wasn't expecting the same quality that my DSLR gives me, but I have to say I'm impressed so far with the stills and movies I've taken so far.  For those of you that seem to have problems getting good results I have to say you need to read the manual before blaming the camera.**update 3/5/14:I think all this type camera would have this problem, but I experienced huge LCD washout on outside shots even with the display brightness turned all the way up.  It was so bad that even on a cloudy day (snow on the ground which I know doesn't help) I had problems seeing the picture I was about to take.  When I reviewed the photos inside they turned out fine.  But I couldn't see well enough to frame the picture they way I would want.I didn't change from my 5 star rating because, like I said, I think all these cameras would have the same problem.

She can now take pictures, videos, and is able to review and delete all on her own. The quality of picture is what you would expect from a point and shoot camera.

2014-03-18 13:26:03-0300 [scrapy] INFO: A lot of my friends can't believe how crisp the pictures are even in low light conditions.  I have taken crisp pictures of small birds utilizing the zoom function.  For a low end camera, it takes very good pictures.  It pays to read the manual AND experiment with the function settings.  For example, there is a setting for low light conditions (which may trigger the flash) but I have found that changing the ISP speed to 1600 can give nice clear pictures in low light without a flash.  It pays to experiment with this camera since the correct settings result in brilliant pictures.  One really needs to take a lot of pictures of one subject in the same setting to get a good idea how these settings work.  Once you grasp the proper settings, the pictures are excellent!

She showed me photos and videos that she's taken of the dogs playing and sleeping!  Small size makes it easy to slip into a pocket--perfect for a trip to Disney World or any vacation.

2014-03-18 13:26:04-0300 [scrapy] INFO: I would start by saying this is a very good "cheap" camera. It is ideal for novice users, or anyone who wants good vacation shots and is not a snob about cameras. It takes very high quality pictures and 720P HD video and is very easy and intuitive. It has nice big screen to look at picture and video you have taken and it interface with your pad or PC via USB or by SD card. The camera requires, but does not come with an SD card. I bought the 64gb card and it is my understanding this is the maximum this camera can use. It has 5x zoom which is not awesome, but adequate for the casual user.  Underwater housings are also available for this camera. For the price, ($69.00 using Amazon Prime) you cannot do better. This is vastly superior to my previous powershot.  It is an excellent bang for your buck and I love the size and quality for average use.

I am a professional photographer and wanted something small to put in my pocket and take to the park with my kids...my DSLR is big and bulky.  I fiddled with the camera for a while and was thinking it might be okay, but I would likely not use it much.  Then I turned off the flash and turned on the vibration control.  Now I LOVE it!  It takes great pictures, even indoors without a flash.  I am quite impressed and would highly recommend this camera.

2014-03-18 13:26:04-0300 [scrapy] INFO: I do a lot of photography, own a lot of cameras including pricey ones by NIKON (7100) and CANON (G10)  and LUMIX (LX7) and SAMSUNG (GALAXY). I also own and use a lot two CANON POWERSHOT A4000 IS, for which I paid just over $100 each. Has the "DIGIC 4" chip used in many of their best DSLR cameras, a 3" display, 8X optical and 8X digital zoom. The review is about the A2500, the little brother to the 4000. It also has the DIGIC 4 chip (that's something important, one smart brain in this box). It has a 28mm wide angle as does the A4000. It has only a 5X optical, 5X digital zoom. The "IS" stands for Intelligent systems, and while BOTH cameras take awesome pictures and represent for normal folks super deals that will keep up with the far more expensive cameras (like those listed above) for normal use, the A4000 IS deals with tricky lighting and the outer margins of early morning, late evening, backlit scenes, and so on, better than the A2500. BOTH are super deals. My tired eyes appreciate that larger display on the somewhat more expensive A4000 IS. I also like to "crop tight" meaning I really zoom in. That again is a slight advantage to the A4000 IS. If photography isn't a passion, either will do a great job. If you spend a few $$$ more the A4000 will give you that difference back over the years in quality shots under tougher situations.

Review the actual product, when you complain about amazon or if it didn't come with a case or sd  card, that doesn't educate a buyer on the camera's performance. I see an overall star rating, and I'm sometimes pushed away from a product because people are upset about things included in a sale.

Great, easy to use camera that comes in a fun color and won't disappoint a 5-10 year old new camera user who also wants to take videos...but will also please the adult user who just wants a no-fuss compact digital camera with HD Video capability to tuck into a purse, pocket or bag for ease of use over a larger DSLR camera outfit. Bonous on our order of this product this time = it came with a free SD Card! Pairing it up with a CoreLogic slim case and it's a great Santa Gift for our child!

2014-03-18 13:26:05-0300 [scrapy] INFO: Like many other owners of this camera, I downloaded the manual onto my iPad2 home screen rather than print the 100-plus pages. There are many functions to discover and implement--including a self-timer, and the iPad makes it convenient to learn the functions, even when I am waiting at the doctor's office. That being said, I still have not learned all the functions because the numerous icons therein are like learning a foreign language. But I AM learning them little by little.Because I am a beginner with digital cameras, I am using the most-basic functions first, such as using auto-focus pretty nearly exclusively to help me become familiar with the camera. So far so good, and I truly enjoy using the camera and printing the photos, which have all come out to my satisfaction. Getting back to the manual:  This 100-plus page manual is packed with information making this camera surprisingly high-tech for such a compact camera. Without the manual to describe and explain all the functions, I doubt that I would enjoy this camera as much as I do. And the camera price is extremely reasonable, as is that of the case that protects it well.As for having to buy a memory card, as one reviewer pointed out, when we used to buy NEW film cameras we did not expect to receive a free roll of film with it.USB cable not included! either! but check the online manual and you may find it listed under "Optional Accessories."

It's great for events where a more professional camera would be a hassle to carry, but a cell phone camera would be lacking. I used it at a meet and greet after a concert, and it took excellent photos of the artist and me. I used it recently to snap some photos of Christmas lights, and I was pleased at the quality. It's a great budget camera, with a small zoom, but it takes great photos.FYI, some people complained because it doesn't contain a USB transfer cable, it's easier to just take the SD card out and put it directly in your computer to transfer photos.

This is the fourth one of the several that I have purchased over several years, because I have purchased them as presents for my grown kids. This one has 16 megapixels, and it takes great photos of things that are moving. I took a photo that included the TV in the shot, and the close up showed the picture on the screen of the TV perfectly.  I have a slight tremor in my hands, and I can take good pictures using this camera despite this. I have also been known to accidentally drop my camera, even though I try to use a lanyard around my neck to secure it. So far, even with dropping it, my older Canon camera hasn't needed to be repaired.

2014-03-18 13:26:06-0300 [scrapy] INFO: This is my 6th point and shoot (P&S) camera in 9 years, ranging in price from $200-$300. I have had 1 Bell & Howell, 3 Nikons and this is my 2nd Canon P&S camera. The last 2 P&S cameras I had I literally wore out by taking so many pictures. I bought this as a second camera for my husband (who doesn't usually take pictures) to use when he goes hunting with my son. I chose a Canon because I have a Canon DSLR and love it. I also wanted an inexpensive camera, because I thought it would sit on the shelf for most of the year. Of course it did not come with a memory card, as I have yet to buy any camera that does.To test this camera, after shooting indoors for a bit, I took it to the park. Luckily, what started out as a sunny day turned cloudy, allowing me to test the camera in different lighting. This is a typical low priced P&S camera.  Like all P&S cameras, this one performs best in bright, outdoor lighting. However, the ease of use and quality of pictures for the small price tag makes this a good buy. This is one of the better P&S cameras I have had.Although no instruction manual was in the box (other than the very basics), it was easy to figure out how to manually set this camera, which is a must for me. I liked the fact that it has a PROGRAM setting, which allows me to set a program manually. Even if I switch to another setting, it saves my manual settings, allowing me to switch back and forth between settings. That was great when I tested it, because the lighting went from sunny to cloudy and back again. I could easily switch from AUTO to LANDSCAPE to PROGRAM (my manually programmed settings) and back, depending on lighting and activity, all while holding my 6 month old. The pictures I took while holding my baby (who was trying to grab the camera) of my 4 other children who were riding a moving train turned out surprisingly good. I also manually adjusted the ISO to 1600 and took some shots while holding my squirming baby, and the pictures were not as noisy as I thought they would be.This is a great camera for the price. I would definitely recommend it for anyone, especially those who are ready to do some manual adjustments to get better pictures, but not ready to spend a lot of money. I am glad I bought this camera, and I am happy because I think I will actually use it more than I originally thought!

However although I really bought this camera for my wife, I do enjoy taking it with me when I am out myself. It is easy to slip into the pocket, and quick to get ready to take a photo. The quality of the photos is brilliant. The colors are so vivid, and real. The Auto-focus is perhaps the best that I have seen is a compact digital camera. The screen shows what points the camera is focusing on, so you know instantly your subject is in focus - of it you need to re-frame your image.Most importantly the actual photo taking is quick. Some digital cameras will blur when the subject moves at the point the photo is taking, because of the delay in processing the photo onto your memory card. I've not had any such problems with this camera.I would recommend this camera to serious photographers who, like me just like to carry a camera everywhere they go. Or as a 1st camera for someone new to digital photography.

( nope but once it charged it was fine) but not only was it easy for me to take clear wonderful photos of my reunion weekend, it was easy for my friends taking photos with it too to just use it as well.  the automatic sensing flash was nice too. the digital uploads of the photos ( with separate purchase of the cable) also could not have been easier. i also liked the little bag that came with the package. it had a nice belt clip. also if i didnt have a belt loop it was very easy to tuck in my pocket and not have to schlump a large camera and case along. it was dropped by accident on a hardwood floor and kept on going with no problems.  everybody went oh no! and i was like nope! its good! say cheese!the price couldnt have been nicer also.. very pleased with my new Canon Powershot!

It is capable of producing 720p HD files at the touch of a button. One of the thoughtful things about this camera is the inclusion of the movie button. You do not have to fidget about with all sorts of controls in order to get the video going. Rather you go back to that simple button and the rest is history.Another nice feature is that this product is newly minted with an ECO mode which is designed to reduce the power consumption on your camera.The Canon brand has made cameras its specialty and the Canon PowerShot A2500 holds true to type. This model brings out all the features that you would expect of a camera of its class but has the added advantage of making it easier for the consumer to access those features. In other words you get the best of both worlds with a great camera and easy usage.Verdict:There are no major surprises with the Canon PowerShot A2500.

2014-03-18 13:26:07-0300 [scrapy] INFO: For $99 this is a good camera.  I needed something lightweight for hiking/fishing etc when I do not want to take my SLR.  The quality is fine and the capabilities are good for the money.  Battery lasted 10 days with light use including some video, so I feel that is OK.  This camera allows you to always have a capabilty in your pocket, certainly better than the typical phone camera, and with longer battery life.
