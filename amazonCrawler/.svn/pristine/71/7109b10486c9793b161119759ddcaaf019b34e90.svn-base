<items><item><bodytext><value>I ordered this for my mother in law as a gift for her husband. I own a Nikon cool pix L100 and recommended this l820 and they are very happy with it. I wish I had waited and got the L820 it is the same as a L100 but with a little better everything. Thanks BB</value></bodytext><star>5</star><productid>2</productid></item><item><bodytext><value>Camera takes excellent photos, love the features and ease of use. 30X zoom is powerful and great for taking photos of subjects normally too far away.</value><value>Only complaint is the lens cap design is very poor. The lens cap must be removed before turning the camera on, or potential damage to the lens mechanism is likely.</value></bodytext><star>5</star><productid>2</productid></item><item><bodytext><value>I really don't know much about what I am doing when it comes to photography but this camera makes it super easy!! Very impressed thus far!</value></bodytext><star>5</star><productid>2</productid></item><item><bodytext><value>I am really enjoying my Nikon. It was a good price and works really well. It is easy to use &amp; lightweight &amp; takes awesome quality pics.</value></bodytext><star>5</star><productid>2</productid></item><item><bodytext><value>Have a professional photographer friend who suggested this model camera. Wasn't wanting a SLR because it was too bulky for my need. Did not want a point and shoot due to lack of features. This hit the mark. Great camera! Only downside is that you have to remember to pop the flash up manually even if it is in flash mode.</value></bodytext><star>5</star><productid>2</productid></item><item><bodytext><value>Despite that the battery is not rechargeable but I never regret it. This camera is amazing. All the languages included, Great quality and it is not draining the battery like any other models. Durable and great quality. I am very happy with it. Shipping with these guys was very decent and quick. No damages especially I bought two units from them. It came with lens cover, Lanyard, set of battery and manual. It only need a memory card and you good to go immediate. I am very highly recommend it.</value></bodytext><star>5</star><productid>2</productid></item><item><bodytext><value>I picked this camera because I wanted bells and whistles (1080p video recording, 30X zoom), but also ease of use, a camera that uses the same memory card as my previous camera, uses standard batteries and has an auto setting feature.  I've used the auto settings on the camera outdoors (beach),  indoors (party) and  portraits and all the pictures came out great.  In time I hope to use the more advanced settings/features but until then, I'm very happy with the ease of use and quality of the pictures.</value></bodytext><star>5</star><productid>2</productid></item><item><bodytext><value>After shopping and examining a variety of cameras of this this type and in this general price range, I found the Coolpix L820 to be just right.  It is light and easy to handle even with one hand.  It's auto-focus function is quick and accurate.  The zoom is terrific and functions smoothly.  There is a terrific suite of photo editing and enhancement tools build into the camera.  The viewing screen is sharp, very "color true", and big enough to allow for a good preview of composed pictures.  There are so many features and capabilities on this camera that it I still haven't exhausted them all.  This is a little bit more camera than a simple point and shoot, but its complexities are easy to master with a little practice and open up many possibilities for creativity.  It's connectivity to other digital devices is good, but requires a cord to transfer pictures from internal memory (which is abundant) or from a memory card which is easy to install or remove.  It would be nice to have wifi/bluetooth connectivity with this camera, but I think that the range of capabilities outweighs this unless you are someone who likes to take a picture and immediately share.  So far, all my results have exceeded expectations and I have enjoyed using the various built-in photo editing tools to make my pictures appear even better.</value></bodytext><star>5</star><productid>2</productid></item><item><bodytext><value>The photos are so clear and bright and the zoom is fantastic.
