"I have shot with Nikon for many years \(since 1976\). I\'ve also owned 3 other digital bodies and 3 film, I consider myself a very serious amateur photographer. I was looking forward to the full frame D600 even before the release and spent \$2095 buying the body which I paired with Nikon\'s new 28 \- 85 mm lensThe first thing I noticed was that after a long shooting day \(over 500 images\), when I downloaded files in bridge was very visible spots \(appeared to be oil\) on the sensor. The dust spots continued to get worse and at the point of my images were impossible to use I returned my camera to the store where I purchased the store cleaned my sensors and reported that all was well.  In less than 500 shots the dust returned.  I again returned the camera to the store and was told there was nothing else they could do except return the camera back to Nikon for service.  Now, I am without a camera for a minimum of six weeks and have no grantee that the problem will be resolved.I have called Nikon customer service and was told that these isolated cases are being handled case by case and that what you read on the internet are not necessary true.  I also received an email from Nikon with the same response.  Man up Nikon.There seems to me a manufacturing issue which is causing the spots to appear in the pictures after 150\+ or so shots.  At this point I am not recommending to anyone that they purchase this or any other Nikon product.I am very disappointed the product and have been told that there were no widespread problems.  So a camera that owned less than three months and spent \$2095 on, in addition to \$600 for a lens is defective.Nikon needs to\:  offer a free solution and acknowledge there is a problem.", negative
"I am on my second D600 body. The first one was purchased here on Amazon next week after the camera launched. The dust accumulated after first 100 shots and some of the particles would not go away even after the Rocket Air blower was used several times. The dust spread out very quickly \(not just in the upper left corner\) and after 2000 shots, the ENTIRE sensor was covered with spots, over 10 of which were visible at F4 and a couple at F2.8. Returned the camera, waited a month or so and got another one. After first 5 shots \- several spots appeared. Serial \# starts with 3031XXX. After another 2000 pictures taken, it seems to be worse then the first body. Some of the spots are REALLY large and I cannot blow them away. Do not want to do the wet clean myself and not willing to be without the camera for 2\-3 weeks and deal with horrible Nikon service \(most recently had my Speedlight SB\-800 serviced, could not get it back from them for a month \- awful experience\!\) Have to shoot a wedding today, I will use my F1.4 and F1.8 optics to avoid visible spots. This is absolutely unacceptable and disturbing. This was my dream\-come\-true camera. I loved the weight of it, the feel, the features, the image quality...  I feel so frustrated with this problem\!\!\!I was considering D800, but because of the file size and possible left AF problem decided against it.So... Now what\? I have recently invested in bunch of Nikon lenses and really love them. I really want this camera to work and will probably give another D600 one more shot. I will update this review and change it to 5 stars, once they fix this REAL problem at the manufacturing level.", negative
"The Nikon D600 has either design or manufacturing flaws of the oil dust on its sensor. You will have pictures with many tiny black dots. It\'s Nikon\'s responsibility to\- Stopping selling the defective product, or\- Recall it and issue credit to its customers.It\'s unethical to continuously sell this defective D600 camera with a discount to the consumers.", negative
"same thing with other reviews memtioned, \:\(  otherwise it\'s a very good camera.  I wish Nikon will fix this problem soon.", negative
"This camera is a piece of crap.I bought a refurbished one that had supposedly had it\'s sensor issues fixed. The more I photographed the worse it became. So KEH, my seller, exchanged it out. Next camera had the exact same issue. They offered me a third camera but by this point I\'d done enough research to know I could be playing this game awhile.  So I exchanged and upgraded to the D800E. So glad I did plus the extras I bought for the D600 work with the D800E.", negative
"Wow Nikon has always been my camera of choice and I have the D800 as well, had the D90, D7000, D7100 then jumped up to the D800 and now this..... But after maybe 500 shots I had dirt on the sensor or my D60 so I just hoped it was normal, forked over the \$75 and got it cleaned. Now after 150 shots or less I have even more crap on the upper part of my sensor with just this small number of shots. Never took my lens off outside and clean conditions. My guess, my camera that I purchased here at Amazon on Aug 7th is another one that has this issue with the gap around the shutter. I am trying to get Amazon to flex its muscles and get me a refund because I surely don\'t want to deal with Nikon and the way they have handled this whole situation. If not for the residue on the sensor the D600 rocks. But thats not my reality nor the camera I paid \$2000 for. Just get the D610. Don\'t even think about getting a used or refurbished D600.", negative
"I have the D600 with many problems like focusing and not excepting firmware updates. You can buy the D 610 for less.", negative
"I am very disappointed with the way NIKON has handled this entire D600 fiasco.  I can best alert you against this camera by copying the words from a recent review.  These are not my words but serve as a good guide.  I hope NIKON will read this and be very ashamed.  I was very lucky because I was able to return the entire D600 camera kit to Costco after I pleaded with them and showed them how this camera is defective and NIKON will not face up to it and instead kicked the consumer in the gut by correcting the problem with the introduction of D610, instead of doing the morally ethical thing of recalling the D600s.  I too noticed the oil and dirt spots on my pictures.  The following is taken from\[...\] \:Here\'s a quote from a Nikon dealer\:\"Nikon has devalued our remaining new \[D600\] inventory and will make it almost impossible for us to sell it off short of taking big losses. We\'re already trying to move our current inventory by taking a \$100 hit on the profit side and I don\'t think that\'s going to be enough. If anyone thinks I\'m ordering new D610\'s today \(short of specific order requests\) they\'re nuts.\"Now let\'s look at things from a well\-informed prospective customer viewpoint\:  Choice 1\: a D600 that might or might not have a shutter issue  Choice 2\: a D610 that fixes the shutter issue \(to assume otherwise would also be to assume that Nikon is totally incompetent, in which case see Choice 3 \;\~\)  Choice 3\: buy a Canon 6D  Rumored Choice 4\: Sony and Pentax introducing competitive full frame camerasWhat I fail to understand is Nikon\'s behavior here. They have done the following by staying quiet about the D600 issues and trying to get around them by doing a sleight of hand with the D610\:  Eroded key customer confidence  Devalued a product by their actions, which leads to\:  Lowered their product margins  Added another lingering inventory problem, which also leads to lower profit marginsCoupled with all the repair costs that the D600 triggered, how can Nikon\'s response be the right answer to the problem\? In retrospect, the proper solution was to recall all D600\'s and examine them for defective shutters. If found, replace it and charge the cost of that replacement to their shutter supplier. That kind of response should have\:  Increased key customer confidence  Not devalued the product  Lowered their product margins \(cost of shipping cameras, inspecting them\)  Not created a lingering inventory problem or the need for another productBut here\'s another new problem I\'m seeing in my In Box. Consider this quote\: \"My D600 is coming up on end of warranty. I\'m not a heavy user so I\'m not sure if my camera has the problem. It seems like it needs more cleaning than I expected. What happens when my warranty expires\? Will Nikon still replace my shutter for free if it\'s defective\?\"Nikon is, as usual, will likely remain silent on such questions, which isn\'t going to increase customer confidence.

"From Nikon in Europes homepage\:To users of the Nikon D600 digital SLR cameraThank you for choosing Nikon for your photographic needs.Some users have indicated the appearance of multiple granular dust spots in images captured with the Nikon D600 digital\-SLR camera. These granular dust spots are reflections of internal dust generated with camera operation, or external dust particles that have found their way into the camera, either, or both of which, have adhered to the camera\'s low\-pass filter.While the structure and concept of digital\-SLR cameras makes the complete elimination of these dust spots very difficult, it has come to our attention that, in some rare cases, they may be reflected noticeably in images. Therefore, Nikon is informing users of a service to reduce this issue.ResolutionAs a first step, please follow the guidance from the User\'s Manual \(pages 301\-305\) related to the \"Clean Image Sensor\" function and manual cleaning using a blower. If these measures do not remove all dust particles and you are still experiencing problems, then please consult your nearest Nikon service center. They will keep your camera, examine it thoroughly, and service it as needed.\[...\]", negative
"Nice fx camera and comfortable in the hand . Great pictures with mid price nikon lens but the spots continue to haunt this model. The sensor after 150 shots has spots on it. When you enlarge a photo is when you can see how bad it is. I waited to order one to end of year thinking the bad ones were returned but no luck, i got a bad one. I don\'t relish having to have the sensor cleaned almost out of the box.", negative
"At \$700 off for the kit I was close to buying.  Without that incentive, I am going to wait until they get the internal debris problem fixed.  Nikon seems to use their customers as beta testers.  It seems like every time they come out with a new DSLR it has some kind of problem.  The D70 \(which I own\) had front\/rear focus issues.  It seems like Nikon got around that buy adding focus tuning on the higher end cameras.  Nothing like \"do it yourself\" QA.  The D800 has left\/right focus issues.  The D7000 and now the D600 are plagued by \"internal debris.\"  Do some research on Nikon D600 dust\/oil.  Hey Nikon, How about some good old fashioned Japanese quality\?  I know a lot of this stuff is manufactured in Thailand, but still.  Get it fixed or drop the price again.Added after the initial review\:Last week I spent dozens of hours researching the D600, including trying it out in a camera shop. The folks in the camera shop were well aware of the oil\/dust issue. I called Nikon USA service and here is what they told me\:1\) Not all D600 bodies have this issue. Only some do.2\) If you purchase a D600 that has the issue Nikon will take care of the problem. They will clean the sensor.3\) If the problem recurs, they will clean the sensor again. If they determine that the body can\'t be repaired, they \"will see\" if they can replace it. When asked what \"will see\" means, he said that if it is in stock.4\) Nikon has not compiled a list of affected serial numbers.5\) Nikon doesn\'t have an understanding of what is causing the problem on some D600 bodies.6\) The customer is responsible for the cost of shipping the body to Nikon for the checkout\/cleaning.I am sure that this camera takes great photos.  But for \$2,000 do you want a camera that may need to go back to Nikon for periodic sensor cleanings\?  Nikon, please fix this problem.Added on January 8th\:If you want to read more on the internal debris issue, check out the D600 reviews from DPReview, Ryan Brenizer or Thom Hogan.  I\'d post a link, but Amazon doesn\'t allow external URLs.Added on January 10th, 2013\:Another place to research this issue is lenrentals.com.  They have an extensive article on the D600 sensor debris issue.  They own dozens of D600 so there experience is based on many D600s, not a single sample.", negative
"I just returned my second D600 due to the sensor spots.  The first one went back 24 hours after I got it.  The camera store people were nice and gave me a replacement, and even checked for sensor spots before it went out the door.  I was there.  We saw nothing.  I got home, did some shooting, checked it the next day, found maybe four or five sensor spots \-\- to me, that\'s a little soon, but still acceptable.  Today I returned it after a day of shooting, indoors, no dust, one lens change \-\- and literally dozens of sensor spots.  I made a phone call to Nikon, and the rep told me she\'d never heard of this \-\- yeah, right.  In the meantime, several other photographer friends are having the same problem.  Nikon clearly has an issue with these.  Things happen, but to pretend it isn\'t, despite widespread reports by photographers, photographic sites, and even camera rental places, is unacceptable.  It\'s a shame, because in all other ways, it\'s a wonderful camera for the price, full of features, and usable by pros and amateurs alike.  It\'s a great move into full\-frame, because it offers the option of shooting DX, so as to be able to use existing lenses.  But when quality is bad, none of the rest matters.", negative
"I own the nikon d700 for a year and half and was looking forward to upgrading my nikon bodies. I intended to get the d800 and the d600. I did many research into these bodies. Finally it was down to decision time, knowing that the d800 has left focus issue the d600 has oil issue, i still went ahead and bought the d600 hoping that I won\'t get a bad copy because the d700 is such a \"reliable\" and a great camera. I was giving the nikon brand the benefit of the doubt. Well what do you know, oil start appearing on my d600. Return it back immediately.A customer spending this much cash on a product from a nikon brand should have the peace of mind of buying a quality product.  I don\'t understand why Nikon is denying the fact that the d600 has oil problem on its sensor.  Do they think that their customers are dumb asses\?The entire chain of command within nikon is tarnishing what this brand stand for.I now own a Canon 5d Mark iii.", negative
"This camera sprays oil from the mechanical shutter on to the sensor, causing spots on the images you photograph.  The problem doesn\'t show up until you\'ve owned the camera for several months.  Then Amazon doesn\'t want to issue you a full credit.It\'s the worst.  Don\'t buy a D600 and don\'t buy it on Amazon", negative
"THIS JUST IN\: Had trouble using an AI 200mm Micro\-Nikkor lens on this camera. Found little help in the thick manual or using Google, searching AI. And so...I called Nikon.After the rep checked for about 60 seconds or more with someone else, I get this response, confirmed in writing\: \"Thank you for calling Nikon today. I am sending you an email confirming that your D600 is not compatible with AI lenses. If you have anymore questions please feel free to give us a call back.\"THANK YOU, THANK YOU KEN ROCKWELL \(A HERO, like travel advocate CHRIS ELLIOTT\)\: \"\(rude word\)\/use the NON CPU LENS data menu and you\'re good to go\!\" And so I would be, except seconds after the Nikon ruling, I obtained a return authorization from B\&W \(generous, since just past 30 days\), and immediately caught the postal carrier. So out about \$35 for two\-way shipping on the aforementioned lens.Support Rockwell and Elliott for the betterment of humanity, or something short of that.PREVIOUS\:Reconditioned D600 arrived with a mini\-minor issue\: the rear screen protector kept falling off. From examination, the top tab seems to have been broken.A call to Nikon Service brought a shuffle, with the first representative indicating that this might not be covered \-\- after two days from purchase. The next representative started grilling me on whether I knew how the screen worked, if I had broken it. To hell with Nikon. I hung up and order another from China for pennies. And for this it has totally annoyed a 48\-year customer, before retirement a member of NPS \(Nikon Professional Services\).", negative
"This could have been a fantastic camera had Nikon handles its customers\' complaints seriously. Instead they pretended there were no problems and that only a few isolated users had problems with oil spots. Now Nikon has further upset its customers by releasing the D610 further de\-valuing the D600. I will never purchase another NIkon product unless they eventually recall the D600 and make it right.By the way if you have a D600 and never saw any oil spots take your camera off the automatic setting and shoot a landscape with clouds at f22. You will see the oil spots right away.", negative
"Had my D600 for a couple months and didn\'t notice too much of a problem.  We were into over 5000 photos when dust spots suddenly went from mild to severe over the period of about 4 hours ..... during a product photo shoot.  I was so embarrassed for my equipment and I didn\'t have a clue what to tell the manufacturer, who finally left and asked to reschedule once the equipment was repaired.  I was embarrassed to say the least.Anyway, I just received my camera back from Nikon.  They still won\'t say what is going on or if it was really \"fixed\" or just cleaned.  Time will tell, I guess, but I am so discouraged because I don\'t know if this will continue or not. Of note, I had a D200 for 5 years and never needed the sensor cleaned once, and the D600 needed cleaning in the first 3\-4 months.  To make matters worse, Nikon took almost 4 weeks to return the camera, that sucks.  They have a web site where you can find updates, but it\'s all but worthless\: they use cryptic codes to say what is going on, and they may or may not update the site, so it really doesn\'t reflect what is going on.  For instance, the site said it was done for 6 days, and when I called them, they said, \"well sometimes when it says \"bill\" for a long period of time, it\'s actually been shipped.\"  So even their own techs know that the web site info means nothing.Something is clearly wrong here and from the reviews, I don\'t think it\'s a small percentage at all.  One rental place said all 20 of their cameras were effected.  20\/20 with the same issue\?  Mnnn.I hope this isn\'t a life long issue with this camera.  It was cleaned under warranty although I am not sure why ... if it were something I did, they wouldn\'t cover it under warranty would they\?I wouldn\'t have bought the camera if I knew about this issue.  I would have waited, it\'s just not worth the embarrassment and unknown future.  I surely can\'t send this camera in for 4 weeks several times a year ...not to mention that after the warranty is gone, I will have to pay for it.I wouldn\'t recommend this camera at all right now.  Once Nikon says they have the problem fixed ...... then no problem.UPDATE\:  So the review above was done in Early 2013.  Since then I sent the camera back in July 2013 and I was told they replaced the shutter.  Today, October 2013, I am sending the camera back for the third time for the same dirt\/dust\/oil spots.  After talking with Nikon support over and over again concerning the same problem, it\'s my opinion that there is little sympathy or understanding of what this is putting customers through.  Out of 12 months that I have owned the camera, it has been out of my hands for more than two months.  That\'s not the bad part.  The bad part is they apparently don\'t know how to repair this problem and I am stuck with a dud.  The attitude that I get from Nikon is, \"well, that\'s just your bad luck.\"  They also \"have no information about the problem.\"  It\'s just surreal dealing with these people.  It would seem no one knows anything and no one has the \"authorization\" to do anything to make the situation right.  The support is nice enough, just none of them know or can do anything.  I have never had an experience quite like this with a technology company.  Anyway, at this point, I don\'t want the camera anymore.  It\'s not reliable and they apparently don\'t know how to repair the problem yet.  This is just not worth the hassle, for me.  I hope this helps someone else.", negative
"I was expecting that dirty sensor issue was limited to only few cameras. It looks that I was mistaken. Beside purchasing camera from Amazon I did go to BestBuy an Costco and cameras from all places were  showing dirt on their sensors. I returned all of them and now wait and see if Nikon will correct the problem.", negative
"I really believe there is no excuse to give this product a 3 and above stars rating, even if it takes amazing pics. I do not buy a Ferrari to have its fuel injection system cleaned every 100 miles, and then I say...\"OK, that is fine, it is a Ferrari \!\". This is just an absurd Nikon has to address. I was a Nikon guy during all of my photographic amateur life, and I had several models from the 4004, N90, to an F4, to a D70, 7000 and a 700 now. I wanted a new body, and it will not be a Nikon, unfortunately.I live in a Country with an absurd tax regulation system charges and a less than desirable quality level of service from Nikon. I just can not afford to buy a product I know I will have to have it serviced regularly. This is not something \(wet cleaning the sensor\) a normal person can do alone.I hope they fix this and promote a decent recall. This is not a 10 bucks product \!Before someone asks\: I have not bought one, but the guy next to me did and it had the same oil issue 2 days later. Incredible.", negative
"I was eagerly awaiting this impressive camera since first pictures started showing up on rumors web sites. I\'m not a photographer, just an enthusiast but the time came to upgrade my Pentax iST\-dx and I wanted to get something of a high quality which will produce photo and video assets you can be proud of for years to come. So after consulting with my family \(\$2600 is a big deal for our budget\), reading a bunch of favorable reviews \(including Amazon\'s dpreview.com\) I decided to buy into Nikon platform and D600 in particular. Soon after expiration of the 30 days Amazon return policy, the infamous dust issue started happening. Since Amazon would now charge a prohibitive restocking percentage I decided to wait until \"the dust settles\" and sell it on eBay with a small discount. To my surprise Nikon dropped price for the same kit I bought they ask \$700 less and that is just 3 month after the product launch. I think they decided it will be cheaper to do this instead of recalling the camera. My value in this camera vanishing quicker than real estate equity after the housing bubble. Why bother admitting the guilt if you can just burn early adopters and drop 25\% \(huge margin allows them\) so people will be impulsively buying their defective product without reading reviews. I\'m calling to launch a class action against Nikon, it seem this is the only language their corporate management listens to. And one more thing. Did anyone noticed that after being acquired by Amazon, dpreview.com is now playing along with manufacturers\? They sure get more access to the exclusive per\-releases but it seems that credibility plummeted.", negative
"This is a long post. The quick synopsis is as follows\: The D600 HAS an issue with dust and oil. They have admitted to an issue finally in Feb. Their cust service is the worst I have experienced. After 6 months we got a full credit from the vendor and purchased a Canon 6D. We are thrilled with the Canon. The technical features are not the D600 but the Canon has not come with the free oil and dust spots that the D600 came with. For more details please feel free to read the entire post. BUYER BEWARE.I bought my wife a D600 in November at this great price of \$2,395 from a different vendor \(Amazon did not have the same price.\) With the holidays we were not able to do too much with it but by February we noticed the issue of dust\\oil\\noise on many of her pictures. My wife was a professional photographer and as we get closer to retirement we are thinking of a small cottage photo business or just enjoying a passionate hobby. This should have been a great experience.We went to the Addison Texas Nikon photo school on Feb 23 and 24th. We decided to wait until after the class to send it in as we followed Nikon\'s protocol. They reviewed the pictures we sent in and they said send it to them in California. On the 25th we sent it in which cost us \$137 \(\$122 for shipping and insurance and another \$15 for the box and packing materials.\) We sent it in two day UPS. They did not even acknowledge receipt of the camera until the next week even thought we had proof of delivery. Once they looked at it they simply cleaned the sensor and sent it back.Right out of the box, we barely had the camera body open for 10 seconds while we attached a lens, we experienced the same problem. We called them and went through the hassle of sending in the pictures. By the way we received different instructions each time for the proper way to send files and each time it took several tries. They really should know how to handle large files and be consistent. We implied once again that we did not want to have to pay another \$137 to send it back. We received the same email saying sorry but you will need to send us the camera again. We had enough. We were never offered a prepaid UPS label.We went to a great local distributor. We did not buy this from them but since we have shopped there before they were gracious enough to listen to our situation and send it in to the Melville operation on our behalf. Just like you our camera was put on parts hold. They eventually, after 4 weeks and me getting on the phone with them, replaced the shutter mechanism and did a complete low pass filter cleaning. They sent it back apologizing for the issues and even sent me a check to repay me for my original shipping. They explained I should have been offered a free shipping label. There were several other miscommunications that are irrelevant as they had nothing to do with the issue at hand.The camera arrived at the distributor on Thursday and we picked it up on Friday. We shot some pics on Saturday and went to the Dallas zoo on Sunday to put it through some real shooting. We got home Sunday evening and we saw the issue reappear. We started shooting at around 11\:30 AM at 1\:05 PM we noticed the first issue. We figured this out as we reviewed the shots Sunday evening using Nikon\'s software. The spots gradually got worse. Yes we do have the pics to back all of this up which we eventually got to send to Nikon on Monday.Monday afternoon they issues an overnight UPS label. I boxed the camera up and sent it back to them. They had a manager intercept put on the label to review. My wife will be travelling internationally next week and we needed the camera \(we requested a replacement\) before she left. I heard nothing on Tuesday morning but followed up and found out that they had it. I was told I would hear back later that day or early today.  Nothing again. I call up and am told they will speak with the service manager and put in a request for a replacement camera. I would hear within 24 hours. In less than 6 hours they called me and said that the service manager said there is only one spot and they are simply going to clean it and send it back.Now the pictures clearly show more than one spot and additional noise or again more spots. I asked them to review that as I do not believe they reviewed the pictures although why would they agree to overnight something for pickup after they saw the pictures if there was only one spot\?So in less than a week I received a refurbished camera with a new shutter mechanism and a cleaned low pass filter. In less than 4 days they requested the camera back. This is the third time it is in for the same issue. They did not offer to replace the camera. They are simply going to send it back after a sensor clean.Here is the dilemma\: The original place I purchased the camera from has graciously agreed to take it back and put me into another camera. They said we could either get another D600, a different camera or a store credit. That is customer service. That is a great customer experience. Nikon should learn a lesson from this. Right now I am leaning towards getting rid of our Nikon Gear. You see we also bought a D3200 and a Nikon 105MM micro lens as well as some other smaller items. That may  sound drastic but that is how they have made us feel. We would rather have a nice working model of the D600 but how do I in good conscience reward them with more business after how we were treated and how the other people with poorly working D600 were treated. While I have no idea how prevalent the issue is, the manner in which they have handled it is disgusting. I am happy for all the people who I know and hear about that have working D600. However, a \$2000 plus investment for a consumer or a pro is a significant amount of money. With Nikon currently reporting more than a \$159M profit this quarter \(down almost 50\% on a 5\% increase in sales\), why should their customers take this kid of treatment\?For everyone with a good working D600 enjoy. For everyone who has been treated poorly by Nikon customer service I empathize with you. Luckily there are still some great companies that treat their customers with exceptional respect. Nikon could learn a thing or two. They have brought fumeiyo upon themselves.", negative
"The camera has two problems. First, dust and\/or oil accumulates on thee sensor and needs constant attention. This is especially a problem at higher f\-stops. Just dial up to f16 or higher and you\'ll notice hundreds of dots. And it doesn\'t stop after a few thousand activations, as some have indicated. It is also a problem on all the d600s, not just the first ones. If that weren\'t bad enough, Nikon still pretends that this isn\'t a problem, even though they\'ve introduced a replacement camera, the 610. Worse, they imply that it is a user problem. I would avoid the 600 and not trust Nikon on anything. They\'ve lost all credibility. The 600 is largely unusable unless you want to risk damaging the sensor, which might be okay because the camera is basically a \$2000 paperweight.", negative
"The dust issue continues to reoccur OVER and OVER. Local camera shop will clean sensor for \$90. EACH TIME this happens I need to fork over \$90\?\?\? And it happens frequently. Every 1000 shots or so. I won\'t rehash what others have said about Nikon and the D610 but this is so disappointing after spending \$2K on this body.", negative
"The dust and oil splatter showed up on the sensor just past the 1,000 activation mark.  Since I bought this as a backup camera I did not notice the problem until long after my warranty ran out. I purchased a sensor cleaning kit and have now wet cleaned the sensor at least 15 times not to mention almost daily blowouts of the sensor box with a Rocket Blaster to clear dust.  Now with more than 17 thousand activations, it appears the oil and dust issue may be behind me. Would I buy this camera again\? NO. Would I recommend it\? NO. I think Nikon handled this problem with the D600 very badly. I might consider the D610 but not until the refurbished models come out later this year.", negative
"I received it a month ago. It came with three big pieces dusts on the sensor. Did a air blow clean, then after 20\+ picture taken, more dusts showing up. I cleaned it again, after 200\+ pictures taken, more than 50 spots of dust\/oil showed up on the sensor again. And Nikon does not have any acknowledgement on this known issue to many customers. It is totally unacceptable. D600 is becoming a self\-contamination machine\!", negative
"I\'m writing this review at the point where I\'m returning the 2nd body I had back to Amazon. There are two parts to understand, the camera itself, and the issue plaguing majority of these bodies. The first body I had was bought in September 2012, and after buying, I immediately went on an international trip, which was going to be several months, since the body had just come out, and as I was traveling I had not heard about the sensor dust issue. I was shooting away and it was all good. At one point in time I was attending, the Formula 1 Indian Grand Prix 2012 \(I\'ll be attaching a couple pictures\), and I had tickets for all three days, being with a new camera I wanted to test it out and see how the system worked with Sports, given the camera has an unusually small AF area, if you compare it with a D7000, even the D7000\'s coverage is better, but I usually use the center focus point, and I dont mind that too much, but thats just me, some people use all focus points and for them, this is not exactly the best focusing system, in fact this is in my opinion is the biggest downside of the camera technically, which could be a deal breaker for some people.Anyway coming back to the grand prix, so for those 3 days, I used the camera on Continuous high speed, which was using burst of 10 pictures or so, throughout. I got a satisfactory enough keepers, which kind of also proved for me that the camera can do pretty decent in situations such as one I went though. However once I went home and started looking at the raw pics is when I realized the horror, at that point I had clicked about 4k Shutter actuation\'s, about 3k in the 3 days of grand prix shooting. And almost every picture was bloated with dust and oil, the final pictures I decided to process, were in hundreds, and I had to spend time for each and every one of them, the fact that cleaning out those dust spots is not necessarily easy when they are so many of them in each picture. This is when I googled and realized whats has been happening with the D600. I had a macro lens and I immediately took a picture stopped down, and I couldn\'t believe how dirty the sensor was. I immediately took it to a Nikon service center in New Delhi, India, I was charged about \$15 and I got a clean sensor back in half an hour, I hoped that would be the end of it, but it was not the case, after a few hundred shots the sensor was getting dirtier again. And this is when I decided I couldn\'t keep this body. I immediate spoke to Amazon, and they were ready to take it back, once I was back in US. After coming back and reading about how the D600 sensor issue was probably non existent in newer bodies, I decided to order again around New years, but unfortunately I got another body plagued with the same issue, I have now decided that, I\'ll be returning the D600 for a D800, although it doesn\'t necessarily fulfill all my needs, and it might come with some AF issues, however Nikon CAN fix that, and I probably am going to get it fixed, but in the case of D600, Nikon has been completely mum, leaving a good majority of its owners in the dark of any development what so ever, this is very cruel to me, if I hadn\'t invested in an Nikon ecosystem of lenses and flashes, I\'d have walked away Nikon.Leaving the dust issues aside, the D600 is an awesome camera, Dynamic Range, ISO performance, resolving power, and ease of use. Keeping in mind this is not a professional grade body, the cameras controls are very nicely aligned, and having a D7000, it was great to jump onto the slightly bigger body with slightly better ergonomics. If the camera bodies I had used were not having any dust issues, or if Nikon would have owned up to this issue and perhaps suggestion a future fix, I\'d had given the camera a 5 star rating, but with my experience so far, its going to remain 1.", negative
"Even with the negative reviews here about the spotting issues I was willing to take a chance on getting a D600 that didn\'t have this problem, but it was not to be. within just a few shots I was able to see the dreaded spots  when I viewed the picture files my monitor. I completely cleaned the sensor only to have the lubricant spots come back within about 30\-35 shots. There was also an usualy amount of dust collecting on the sensor as well. If it wasn\'t for this problem the Nikon D600 would have been an awesome camera. I found the camera a joy to use and shoot with the controls all laid out in a logical \(to me that is\) manner. The live view worked espically well having the camera mounted on  a  tripod \(ReallyRightStuiff TQC\-14 and BH\-30 ballhead\).I can\'t think of anything I would change on the camera. Yes, I know many have moaned the lack of Exposure control in Movie mode, but I never got around to using movie mode myself. Sadly Nikon has really dropped the ball on QAULITY CONTROL  in producing the D600 and I see the problem exist in the D800 line as well. If not for the spotting problems I would have given the D600 a 5 star rating. Amazon, you should use your collective purchasing power and come down hard on Nikon for this mess, as it is costing you tons of lost revenue and many unhappy customers.", negative
"...same dust and oil issues.  Purchased serial \#3004XXX. Within the first 20 shots noticed spots developing on sensor \(upper left in view finder\)and had dust inside prism area.  I removed many dust particles from the sensor with a \"rocket blower\" but the oil spots required a wet cleaning.  After cleaning, the spots started to reappear within 5 clicks so I returned the camera for a different unit.  Serial \#3035XXX.  The sensor was clean out of the box with only 4 shutter activations on the counter but dust and oil starting to appear at 35 clicks.  This body also has dust inside the prism box.  A rocket blower removed the dust but the oil spots remained.  I also noticed a small area on the mirror mechanism where the paint was starting to flake off, which I suspect is the source of the \"dust\".  These problems show up at f8 and are not user caused and make the camera unusable for landscape and video.  I returned it and the pro level lenses I purchased.  I\'m evauluating other options and would wait on purchasing this camera until Nikon solves these issues.", negative
"I was worried about all the negative reviews regarding the dust\/oil spot on the sensor problem. I put 2000 shots through it. So far, I only see 3 dust spots, not a problem.  The serial no is 3011XXX.  The D600 is a great improvement, coming from the D700 and D300. I\'ll update if there is a dust issue with this D600.Update\:This is the best DSLR I have used. The oil\/dust flaw is real. 500 more shots and the oil\/dust spots got worse. 12 appeared on the high left. I\'ll try more shots to see if it\'ll stabilize. Nikon needs to address this issue. I have over 30 Nikon lenses so going to Canon is out of the question. With the D800 and the D600 having problems, sad days for Nikon users.Update\:12\/22\/2012The function and image quality are the best I have seen. 300 more shots, and the dust\/oil spots didn\'t get worse but are there if you look for it. The bottom line is how much can you accept. Nikon must come up with a resolution for the problems with both the D600 and D800. I will return this camera for an exchange, hoping that I\'ll get luck next time. For those of you who are still waiting, don\'t buy it until Nikon has a fix for it. After 25 years of using Nikon, I\'m slowly losing faith.Update\:12\/27\/2012Tested 2 additional D600 \(not from Amazon\) over the holiday. Same conclusion, dust\/oil spots when you get to 1500 to 2000 shots. One of the D600 has SN 500XXXX. Nikon has no solution for this problem, even with the newer production. If the spots is a problem you can\'t accept, return them. Amazon is good with the return\/refund policy.Update\:12\/30\/20122 more D600 bodies\(not from Amazon\), SN 50XXXXX, same dust\/oil spots, one at 1200 shots, the other at 1500 shots. I won\'t touch another D600 until I see this problem is fixed by Nikon.", negative
"I purchased this camera to travel to South America. I had used a D7000 for a year and I have 4 other Nikon SLR bodies.  Two days into the trip spots started showing up. These are not dust spots since you can see them when the mirror is locked up and they appear as small smudges on the sensor. I finally did a wet cleaning of the sensor with swabs designed for that and most of them came off.  They seem to be back now. What a disappointment from Nikon. Don\'t buy this camera until this problem has been fixed. If I did not have so much Nikon glass I would be looking at Canon full frame cameras.", negative
"I purchased the D600 body about a month ago. I had used all my savings that I have been saving for about 2 years. I was very excited to buy a full frame camera after having used D3000 for about 5 years of my life. In the beginning, when I used the camera with Tamron lenses to take event pictures it did its job. The quality was superb and the colors as well as the focusing capability were excellent. All pictures were done in aperture of f 3.5\~6However, recently I went to New Hampshire with the camera to hike the Lafayette Mountain. This time my main focus was to take excellent landscape pictures. In aperture of f11 to f 22, the pictures I thought they were perfectly focused and framed were filled with complete flaws when I checked with photoshop and lightroom. I saw numerous dust spots on the left corner of each pictures, and the focus was all over the place. Given the fact that there were lots of fogs and clouds as I reached the peak, I understood that sometimes it was hard for camera to decide what objects to focus. However, I was really shocked to see consistent dark spots at the same location of each pictures.It has been over a year since dust\/oil problem has been numerously addressed by thousands of customers and yet Nikon did not fix this problem.This shows that they do not give a s\*\*\*t about the customer\'s concerns as well as their reputation.I am planning on returning D600, Tamron 24\-70 3.5, and Nikor 85mm due to this issue. I will never go back to Nikon again.", negative
"I was very excited to buy this camera last year when it got released. I haven\'t used this camera much over the last year. First few times i did not realize but on my most recent trip when i took my camera, i noticed a flaw in the camera where the ISO and aperture keeps changing automatically\! I set my ISO and aperture to some value, but when i click multiple photos, i get some photos that are underexposed and some that are overexposed.I don\'t know how i should fix this problem... \:\( I moved from Canon to Nikon for D600 for its features. I feel sad to have moved at all...", negative
"After 1000 clicks, the sensor start to show dust on the left corner and Nikon refuse to fix it. As D600 owner, I feel that there is a level of quality that rides on the Nikon name and we pay a premium for this. when the quality drops below, I expect Nikon to stand behind and fix the problem. So disappointed", negative
"Amazing camera... can\'t believe they sell it with the sensor dirty\!\!\!Iso performance is great.Good autofocus except for the autofocus points being only in the center... a pitty.Nikon doesn\'t cover the brand new dirt\/cleaning in the guarantee, so they want to charge me more than 100 USD for cleaning the brand new sensor.Pic showing dust\/oil spots\: i.imgur.com\/el01Vfx.jpg\?1", negative
"This camera has a fatal flaw that is affecting a large number of D600s.  Specifically, the camera mechanism that raises the mirror during exposure is flinging lubricant onto the sensor.  This is completely unacceptable \-\- for more about this go to\: \[...\]Because of this, you get very distinct spotting on your images.  The website referenced about mentions that Lensrentals.com had to clean 100\% of their D600 bodies to fix the problem.For the record, I have three other pro\-grade Nikon DSLRs, and 20\+ Nikon lenses, and have shot only Nikon for 35 years.  I\'ve never seen anything like this on my other cameras.  My first 200 shots were fine, but the more I took the worse this problem became.  Sadly, I purchased the camera for the recent Formula One race in Austin, TX.  I took roughly 3,500 shots during the four days I was at the track.  I am infuriated that most of these shots will need extensive retouching to fix these flaws.If you already own one of these cameras it\'s easy to find the problem.  Shoot a picture of the sky or a light\-colored wall.  Underexpose a stop or two to help you see the spots.  If you have the issue it will be very apparent.And IF you have the issue please return your camera immediately\!  I don\'t have any issues with Nikon on a personal level, but they need to be pressured into fixing this problem \-\- and big companies don\'t spring into action unless financial circumstances warrant it.  If enough people return their D600s \-\- and if enough people complain and make this problem known \-\- Nikon will be forced to fix the design flaw.  Furthermore, they will be less likely to let another design with this flaw slip through into production.I hope this review keeps others from going through this same experience\!", negative
"I really want to love this camera but unfortunately for me, the oil\/dust issues were real. I tried 3 cameras and all produced the same issue. I thought I had a winner with this last one as it was great out of the box but after approx. 700 shots the spots began to show. The feature set and price point are everything I am looking for, very sturdy body for a prosumer camera and would fit my needs perfectly. For me, I was ready to switch to Nikon, I just can\'t see spending \$4k on camera body and a couple lens to be left with this issue. When I called Nikon to see what they can do, my only option was shipping to them at my expense as they do not acknowledge an issue\! This is a 3 week old camera and that is flat unacceptable. I am convinced this is the camera I want, but will wait and let the dust settle, and see how Nikon handles the issue going forward. I am confident they will correct the issue, even if they don\'t admit to it. I usually don\'t write reviews but the issues were bad enough I felt I should. It is just something to consider for others looking at this as well. Do your homework on when the fixed units are out there. I am honestly surprised Amazon has not pulled this with all the other reviews on the same issue. I have seen them do similar things in the past with a receiver from Onkyo that myself and many others had issues with. Fortunately, Amazon is awesome to deal with and I never worry about them standing behind what they sell\!", negative
"Horrible sensor issue just about 2000 shot\! Even can see the huge spot through the view finder\! Horrible customer service, it take them almost a month to get the camera fixed, and I get my camera back with huge scratch on the display\! If you don\'t want to get such issue on such an expensive camera, don\'t buy it.", negative
"My camera broke after only 3 weeks and maybe 200 pictures, handled with tender loving care. Nikon asked me to send it back for repairs. Are you kidding me\! I expect a \$2000 camera to last more than 3 weeks. Luckily I bought it at Costco and was able to get a refund.", negative
"Purchased a refurbished version thinking that not only that there would be cost savings but that perhaps a body that had been through the refurbish process would have had the dust problem checked and fixed if needed. No such luck \- checked after 4 shots and there were hundreds of spots. Am waiting on return receipt and will return the camera. Just FYI.", negative
"First some background\:I started getting serious with photography some years ago and bought the D60 after having only Sony Cybershot point and shoots. Needless to say, this was a major step up in image quality, but also required learning more about photographic science.After a couple years. the AF on the D60 started missing auto\-focus more and more, and my choice was either get rid of it, or get it fixed for mucho Do\-Re\-Mi. It wasn\'t awful and most people wouldn\'t even notice, but i\'m a pixel peeper so it was unacceptable to me.I decided to get a new camera, and needed to stay with DX due to budget, and went with the D5100. This was a pretty good upgrade, but, to be perfectly honest I felt something was lacking. I was concerned that my image quality demands had outgrown the DX capabilities \(I am a pixel\-peeper\).After a year or so, i came across some money, and decided to go for it \- I got the D600 and man, this thing is a major step up from DX. The first few shots blew me away. The improvement in clarity of the FX sensor over DX is immediately noticeable. Now I find myself having to get rid of my DX glass and get FX instead, which is slightly painful, but definitely worth it.High\-ISO performance on DX vs. FX is just night and day.Why 1 star\? Well, the oil splatter problem, that\'s a no brainer. I got it cleaned at about 1000 shots and the oil spots have re\-appeared.Nikon made very little effort to appease consumers.", negative

"I\'ve just bought a D600. After reading the reviews it seems like there have been quite a few issues reported with sensor being dirty \(dust or oil\)\: either right out of the package or after shooting some photos. Probably what\'s happening is excessive oil from moving hinges inside the camera \(shutter\) deposits on the edges of the sensor and then attracts dust. While this shouldn\'t happen out of the box to a high end camera, and Nikon should make modifications during production to minimize the issue, don\'t dispair...For anyone owning a DSLR, I would suggest investing \$50 in sensor cleaning swab\/liquid\/brush kit....Regardless of whether Nikon employees over\-greased the damn levers or not, if you are a heavy use of any camera, learning to clean your sensor periodically will ensure crisp clean photos. It\'s very easy to do. Google \"DSLR sensor cleaning solutions\" and you will see videos of how it\'s done. Very, very, very simple...and you should be set to go....as for voiding the warranty, don\'t be scared...it\'s no different then cleaning your inner mirror or lens...If you put a scratch while cleaning either one of these, you will void the warranty as well...but if you do it carefully and follow basic instructions, you\'ll be fine....I periodically \(every 3\-4 months\) clean the sensors on my cameras. A lot of times I\'ll visually check for dirt\/dust just to make sure I am OK.... In the case of the D600, at worst case scenario, once the excess oils have moved out \(usually happens the more you use the camera\), you\'ll probably not have the issue of constant spotting....and then all you have to do is simply maintain a clean sensor...As for Nikon, they are better off finessing their production line to not over grease the shutters, and they will avoid a lot of insult and refurbishments... it\'s really sad to see their great technology get overshadowed by shoddy workmanship.", negative
"Even though I really like the features and the image quality of my D600 there is one major issue that spoils the whole thing for me\:After just 2 weeks of normal shooting without even changing lenses there gathered a lot of dust and even oil on the sensor. I got this cleaned by the retailer. After another 2 weeks the dust was there again and I found out that there are many others having the same issue. So I sent back my D600 until there\'s a solution \- or otherwise I\'ll wait for Canon\'s 6D", negative
"\+1 on the dust spots on my recent purchase here. After one thousand photos, my d600\'s sensor was very dirty. The 24\-70mm was the only lens mounted on this camera and was NEVER unmounted since photo number one. The photos were clean when I first received the camera. My biggest worry is the camera will generate dust spots in mid shoot. I\'m not talking about small specs, these are very noticeable dust spots on the photos at 2.8\; I will recommend my fellow Amazon friends delay the purchase until this problem is resolved.", negative
"i bought this as a gift for a cousin. The first one arrived broken and had to be returned. the second one arrived and a few days later you advertised this camera at a price \$600 less than I paid. I was told that I could return it but would have to pay a restocking fee of 20 to 50 percent which would wipe out the lower price. I dont think this is a good public relations policy since the camera I received as a replacement of the broken one was received only a few days before the price drop.", negative
"I was a first adopter and bought my d600 in September 2012.  I like to shoot long exposure which accentuates a dirty sensor  After a month I finally noticed spots\/oil and sent the camera to Nikon for repair and in a week they returned the camera.  The spots\-\-dust, oil, whatever were fainter but still there.  I sent the camera back a second time.  The second return from Nikon also had a dirty sensor.  I sent it back for the third time \(each time with images demonstrating the dust\/oil\).  This time I was given a new camera.  I took the second camera out, shot the sky at f22, ran it through some manipulations and found a dirty sensor\-\-out of the box.  I sent the camera back \(now the fourth time\).  This time Nikon listed a bunch of repairs with it\'s return.  I took the camera out of the box shot the sky at f22\-\-dreaded dust and oil spots appeared.  I sent the camera back \(now the fifth time\) in March 2013 and I just received a check for the amount paid for the camera.  Now I am wanting a full frame sensor camera and simply don\'t trust Nikon.  Just wondering if problems with early iterations of this camera have been repaired in later ones.  People who don\'t shoot long exposure or at small apertures might not notice dust\/oil.  Those who do, will.  BTW, Nikonusers.usa refused my review that pretty much said what I said above.  No rant.  Just facts.  I bought this camera from Amazon but discovered dust problems past return date.  I simply don\'t want to deal with Nikon again where reps appear to talk from talking points, saying you can\'t believe what you read on the internet.

"I called Nikon several times concerning the oil spatter issue I\'ve been reading in Amazon and other review blogs to see if they corrected the issue.  I\'ve had to leave voice messages because no one seems to pick up their phones or the queues are way too long.  I wanted to purchase a new body as the features of this body sounded excellent except for the oil issue.  Most reviewers have said that they cannot get any feedback from Nikon and that the company has failed to address this issue publicly in any of the camera forums or on their website.I never got any responses back to my calls or my emails.  I see on their site that they just dropped the price of the body below 2K US now.  I guess there are still a lot of bodies on the selves with the issue and they don\'t want to recall them and fix them.  BUYERS BEWARE. If you get a body, chances are you\'ll have weeks or dealing with a really crappy customer service department to get your oil issues resolved.  I\'ll stick with my DX camera and lenses for now.  Been a Nikon user for over 40 years.  It\'s sad to see a quality company put out a defective camera and not conscientiously address it to their fans and users.  It\'s sort of like Toyota and their acceleration issues that they kept denying.My recommendation is don\'t throw your hard earned money into this camera body until Nikon adds up to the issue.", negative
"Take the Nikon Professional D3x body that sells for \$8,000.00 and put it into a more compact sized body with a few less features and less weight while improving the sensor and making it virtually noise free out to ISO 6400 ...then reduce the price by \$6,000.00 while throwing in an execllent \"walk around lens\" called the Nikon 24\-85mm and there you have it...the amazing Nikon D600\!\!\!I am afraid I must edit my previously glowing review\!The Nikon D\-600 takes the most amazing pictures and the bundled deal with the 24\-85mm lens was amazing especially as it is a new release.The sad sad news...after hitting 1010 pictures my sensor is absolutely loaded with oil\/grease and what appear to be either specs of paint or metal shavings. Something is likely rubbing against something causing vibration that spews oil and then shavings where the two mismatched surfaces collide. It takes 1000\+ photos to finally reveal a HUGE defect\!\!\! I have only had the camera seven or so days and now this.In corresponding with a Nikon tech they informed me that they would pay shipping both ways for a cleaning but the camera would eventually have to be returned for a repair\/fix when the entire scope of the issue finally comes to light. That means Nikon does not know exactly what is happening and therefore does not know what to replace or do. Hence they choose to place us consumers on the \"ignore list\" as sales of unsuspecting customers continue.No way am I sending in a \$2000.00 camera twice when the company does not know what the deal is.... now and possibly later.Shame on Nikon...they should immediately halt production of the D\-600 until they know what\'s wrong and can make a camera that is void of this HUGE defect\!\!\! Have they no shame\?\?\?\?\?\?\?The sensor is the heart of a digital camera and loading it with oil\/grease and possibly metal debris that might not be cleanable is only going to leade to having a camera that is never reliable.Shame on Nikon and Shame on Ken Rockwell for telling us to ignore the issue and just deal with it. The best approach is to stop buying the D\-600 and return the ones that can be returned and then see how fast Nikon gets off their throne and fixes this issue\!Halt production Nikon and focus your efforts on a fix\!\!", negative
"DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA UNTIL NIKON FIXES DUST\/OIL WIDE SPREAD PRODUCTION PROBLEMSI bought this camera a little over a week ago.I too have the infamous and common dust\/oil problem. \(seems to just be dust for me thankfully\). Anyway, Nikon seems to refuse to acknoledge the problem and says it\'s basically normal.. I know i don\'t have to speak for others \- but this is NOT normal to have to clean your sensor after a few photos.. every few photos..WILD LIFE YOU NEVER NOTICED WHILE SHOOTING CAN APPEAR NEAR THE TOP LEFT CORNER OF YOUR f8\+ LANDSCAPE PHOTOGRAPHY. \;P ..In all seriousness though, this has been a huge headache. I didn\'t buy mine from Amazon, but i\'m posting here to discourage people from buying a product that was not propertly quality assured.

Please have your aperture at 16 or smaller.  Set it in landscape mode and point at the sky and shoot.  And you too will see how filthy and dirty this camera sensor is.  It need to be cleaned and vacuum the dirt inside the camera body.  You can clean it by your self, but a few hundreds of click, the new dirt will popped up on the sensor.

"I am a newspaper photographer and have had Nikon D200s, D300s, a D700 and \(for my own personal use\) a D800, and have been very happy with these cameras.  I take good care of them and have them cleaned regularly by Nikon Factory Service \(In my opinion, don\'t go anywhere else for service\).  However, the D600 I recently purchased has been a headache right out of the box, that is, noticeable and gradually accumulating dust and OIL SPOTS on the sensor, mostly on the left side of the image \(or the right side of the sensor\).  Nikon has finally \(and Nikon rarely does this\) acknowledged the problem, and they suggest attempting to clean the sensor according to instructions in the camera manual, and if that doesn\'t help, sending it in for factory service.  I suggest skipping trying to clean the sensor yourself.  Send it in to Nikon Factory Service.  I sent mine in two weeks ago and \(interestingly\) the repair is held up because parts need to be ordered and factory service is considering this a major repair.  It sure sounds like they were unable to get the grime of the sensor themselves without major parts replacement.  It is suggested the shutter is throwing lubricating oil, possibly caused by a gap on the side of the shutter mechanism.  I absolutely would not recommend buying this camera at this time.  Do a little research online, and thorougly check your camera.  You may have not noticed the problem because your images are obscuring the spots.  Do a careful test on a uniform surface, such as a wall.  It may help to pop up the contrast a bit on your editing program.  You\'ll discover a lot of buyers have been disappointed because of this problem.  I can\'t imagine anyone even considering purchasing this camera right now.  If Nikon can fix the problem, then they will have a wonderful product.  I am hoping factory service is installing a modified and improved shutter module as well as a new sensor.  Be sure to check your equipment while the camera is under warranty.", negative
"Spot issue is definitely there and I have started noticing it within about 200 shots on \"upper left\" and \"left center\". They are two pretty big black spots not specks. Agreed I have been able to take care of it using LR... but should I have to use Lightroom, and remove  spots in every picture I click \?Why \? Did I get it for free.. and is that why I should stay quite \? No way.This is my 3rd Nikon body. I loved D90 but moved up to D7000 for better low light capability but D7000 to date has a focus issue that I hate to admit, and of course Nikon never owned up one bit.Now I paid 2K with the 24\-85 lens deal and am shocked and surprised that spot\/dust issue persists. I tried a lot to make up my mind to keep it.. but it\'s getting worse. One spot has turned into two..Is this sealing issue, oil issue.. I din\'t know . I just put on single lens and that has stayed in place.. how could these giant blobs be getting inside my camera\? And of all the places on the sensor \!\!\! \#1 job of camera is to click pics and  if it can\'t click clean pics what can it do \?I will be returning mine and keeping D7000 and this hurts.Some additional thoughts given I am current D7000 user, and just sold my D90 in anticipation of me moving to full frame \:1. D600 really really just feels like a D7000 in mos tregards \(even IQ IMHO\)2. Focus points are all stuck in the middle of the sensor even though the sensor is huge given full frame3. Have see better low light performance in D600 as compared to even D70004. More megapixels are good as you can crop much tighter after the fact.5. Overall my D600 is either overexposing or underexposing at the exact same settings with flash on when compared to D7000, could be a camera specific learning I need to work on, but did not see much IQ improvement I was looking forEdit\:Greeko \- I am now more and more convinced that\:1. Problem is with all D600 units as mine was ordered on Dec 28th, received on Jan 2nd, it took only about 150 pics for nasty spots to show up2. I got suckered into the \"deal\" with the 24\-85 lens, which is no longer available.. in part making it emotionally difficult for me to agree mentally to send the camera and lens \(\+128 GB Card \+ WU\-1b wireless unit\) all for 2K \+ tax.. But the good thing for you is that deal isn\'t available anymore so easy decision. That lens also BTW is only 3.5 \- 4.5 much worse than the 17\-50 2.8 Sigma that I keep on my D7000 all the time.3. I will be keeping my D7000 and 3 othe rlenses that I as about to put on e Bay \- 17\-50mm 2.8 Sigma, 50 1.4 Sigma and Tamron 90mm macro..4. I am clearly disappointed, and pretty shocked at Nikon trying to hide this under the rug.. come on Nikon, own this and we will buy this again and love you like we have for years.. otherwise I am not sure I will be able to keep my years of loyalty intact.5. Technology is advancing, and I really think D90 was the last good camera Nikon produced. Time has come for me to start looking, D7000 is barely acceptable with it\'s focusing flaws. I tried D600 and is being sent back now.When Nikon sold faulty focus D7000s and I said it\'s bad people told me \"it\'s higher level camera.. your technique must be wrong.. blah blah blah\" but in the case of D600 there is not a single person who I know owns this camera \(3 of my friends\/colleagues\) who have not had the spots start showing up sooner than later, and we all know what is an acceptable speck of dirt vs really bad blotchy spots.. And given I keep my eye glasses shiny with the glass wipes all day, I can\'t stand this crapola.", negative
"I have taken 3,000 actuations with the D600 and have been pleased with the quality of the images. From the beginning I noticed the dirty sensor issue but since I usually shoot with the aperture mid to wide open this has not been a major issue.A few days ago, I was taking pictures of my 4 year old son at an indoor event. I noticed my autofocus was not working. After playing around with my settings for about an hour and still not getting a picture in focus without manually adjusting the lens, I went to my local camera shop. In retrospect, I should have purchased the camera at my local shop because of the follow up service. The salesman at the camera store played with the camera for a few minutes and tried a couple of their lenses. He said the autofocus mechanism appeared to be broken and I would need to send the camera back to Amazon.I spoke with Amazon and they said I would need to contact Nikon directly because I purchased the product over 30 days ago \(September 29\). I called Nikon and they gave me the address for their returns center and the procedures for the return. They said it is my responsibility to pay for shipping. I said I thought they should pay since the autofocus should not have broke and the sensor should not be getting oil spots on it. Bottom line, the customer service has been poor. They told me several times \(after playing the I need to check with my manager game\) that they would send me a label for free shipping. It has never come \- after repeated calls with their customer service department over two days. Nikon customer service is nice on the phone but NEVER follow through with what they say they will do.I told the Nikon customer service agent that I have bought two cameras and over \$10,000 in Nikon equipment over the last 4 years, and, as a matter of principle, they should pick up the cost of shipping my camera for repair. They must have some type of internal program to wear down customers to minimize their costs. Here is what I learned\:1. Be careful of being an early adopter of technology. I should have waited 6 months for thorough reviews of the camera.2. If buying new technology, buy the equipment at a local camera shop. They will give you better service as they have a strong incentive to please their local customers.3. Nikon does not do a good job with customer service. They are behind the times in this area and do not understand how to build a relationship with their customers.Well, I will be shipping my camera UPS this morning to the Nikon Repair Center and paying the shipping costs. Nikon you win. Your strategy was successful.", negative
"The \"dust particle\" problem with the D600 sensor, which is actually a \"shutter lubricant splatter\" problem is completely beyond excuse. How did that slip by Quality Control. The build\-up on the sensor gets worse over time, and makes the camera completely unusable. My recommendation is Do Not Buy This Camera until Nikon issues a recall and fixes the problem on existing cameras and on all new ones in production.", negative
"I am disappointed Amazon will not return the item for its sensor defect. The 30 day return policy should not apply here since I did like the camera for the first month \- and it was only until I found out after 30 days that there is a fundamental problem with the lens dust\/oil. It would be like buying a car that drives well at certain hours of the day and then not being able to return it because you hadn\'t tested it at midnight when the wheels fall off.", negative
"D600 Serial Number\: 3069\*\*\*I thought Nikon would have resolved the dust and oil problem by now. I had high hopes for this super light weight FX body. I purchased the D600 on March 1, 2013 and returned it on March 5.The Good\: Very light weight FX body. I could not tell the difference in weight compared to my D7000.The Bad\: Very large amounts of debris located on the left side of the frame within the fist 100 clicks.  I was only shooting at f\/5.6. I blew the debris off the sensor with ease using a rocket blower. Smaller dust was noted between 200\-300 clicks followed by another blow off the sensor. There was very little dust noted after 600 clicks at f\/22. No dust was noted after 600 clicks at f\/22 on a blue sky. I was feeling very lucky and happy. Then at around 850 clicks the much talked about oil residue began to appear in the top left corner along with small dust particles.The dust problems occur within the body. The only time I removed the 50 mm prime lens was when I blew the junk off the sensor. After the sensor was clean I would perform an f\/22 blue sky test to make sure the sensor was spotless.", negative
"I have had the D600 for 3 days now. I got it with the Nikkor 70\-200m f\/2.8G VR II and have taken just over 1000 shots so far, all in the beautiful snow of the NY finger lakes. I have owned several DSLR\'s and SLR\'s before, but this is my first full frame DSLR. The photos with this wonderful camera and this fantastic lens are magical. I am still really a brand new user of the D600 and will update my review when I really put it through its paces, but I just wanted to post this quick impression because I am so delighted. Also I have tested to see if I have oil on the sensor problem with the shots I have taken in the pure white snow covering most of the frame, at f\/2.8, and I cannot find a single flaw of this nature. I am using Lightroom 4.3 to view and adjust my NEF images. Reports suggest this is an out of the box problem, so I will hopefully not have this problem. I did also get the kit lens and I have tried it and its OK. I will be replacing it with the Nikkor 24\-70 f\/2.8G shortly. I also have the Nikkor 50mm f\/1.8G which is absolutely excellent and I look forward to using it with this full frame camera. I did also get the wireless adapter with the camera which works well enough and will be useful under some circumstances. Overall I am delighted with the D600 and although I was prepared to return it in favor of the D800 if it did have the oily sensor problem, it does not. I recommend this camera to anyone who wants a full frame DSLR. Do be prepared, as I was, to buy the fantastic FX glass that Nikon makes. I highly recommend taking advantage of the discount offered by Amazon in buying such lenses at the time of purchase of the camera. Also look out for the special offers like free SD card and backpack. I did not see this offer and did not add the free items to my cart, so missed out. Not a biggie since I have 95mb\/s SD cards and an incredible case in the form of the ThinkTank Sling\-o\-matic\/30. My review is to be continued and I look forward to testing out the video even though this is secondary for me.Update\: 12\/29\/12OK, I took more shots at f\/14 to f\/22, again with the Nikkor 70\-200mm f\/2.8G VRII. With a white background I DO have dark spots in the same places on every shot. These are clearly caused by sensor contamination. Out of the box the camera cap has been off no more than 6 seconds for 2 lens changes. This is unacceptable for a brand new \$2000 camera. I will be returning it to Amazon as a defective unit and will change to the D800.Update\: 12\/31\/12I just want to close off this review by saying that Amazon have been very good regarding the return of this camera. Of course they are paying for return shipping on the camera, but they are also paying for the return shipping of accessories I bought for the camera, supplied by other companies. They are not required to do this but have agreed to do so without hesitation. I have already ordered the D800 and it arrives on Jan 2nd. This camera had better not have any left\-wide focus issues or I will drop Nikon and sell all of my lenses. Good luck to those who stick with the D600 and start cleaning the sensor of an out of the box camera. A great camera that will eventually be produced with the levels of quality expected.Update 1\/13\/13I received my D800 to replace this D600 10 days ago. All I can say is thank god the D600 was faulty. I would have never tried the D800 and for about \$700 more it is superior is almost every aspect. Sure the memory cards cost more and it will eat up your disk space faster, but in every way that matters to me the D800 blows the D600 to pieces. I may well write an extensive review of the D800 but to be honest its all already been said. I love Nikon again and paired with the holy trinity lens set plus a few choice primes, the D800 is the best non\-sports DSLR money can buy.", negative
"Upgrading from D90 so the viewfinder is nice and big in comparison.  The noise performance at low light is good too.  Overall, what you\'d expect a full frame camera to be until you start using it and wondering why they decided to do certain things the way they do.More seriously, I have not found a way to change the aperturewhile in video mode even when not shooting.  This is a serious flaw.  The D800 does it and I don\'t think this should be something that\'s left out on purpose if they want a serious video camera.  I have to switch back to photography mode, pick the aperture, then switch back to video mode and start shooting.  If the conditions change while shooting, you\'re SOL.I was also annoyed at how the AF doesn\'t lock in when there is still plenty of light\/contrast in the scene when using a flagship f\/2.8 Nikkor lens.  If the subject is close, it\'s not a big deal because the AF assist light kicks in, but for things like concerts or weddings where you have to stay at a distance and it\'s low light, you\'re SOL again.Furthermore, the AF points are clustered in the center.  This is annoying but I could make it work, just leaves more wiggle room in the rule of thirds.As for the Oil issue, it\'s too early for me to check but this is a serious concern and I hope Nikon comes out and addresses it.  Man up Nikon.  Public Relations do matter.Less serious, why did they reverse the zoom in and zoom out buttons than previous generations\?\*\*\*update \#1 after 2 days of owning\*\*\*\*\*I wanted to make sure my review of the focus system was fair so last night and tonight, on this holiest of weekends \(Halloween\), I took the camera out to a few bars and clubs.  This time I had an SB\-800 flash on the camera which means that the camera uses the flash\'s Auto\-Assist matrix light.  Again, the camera failed to lock in focus on any other point except for the center.  Again, I was using the Nikkor 24\-70mm f\/2.8 \(a freaking \$1900 pro lens\).  I don\'t think I can really trust this camera too much in low light which is sad considering I got a full frame camera for low light.  The AF system is severely lacking in this camera.Another problem I found is the LCD screen is larger but very poor. I guess it\'s better that pictures in the back look worse than on the computer since in the past it was the other way around with my Nikons but I just can\'t trust this camera very much during these situations.\*\*\*update \#2\*\*\*I had 3 very different shoots yesterday.  One was at a professional sports arena pretty close to the court.  Using the 85mm f\/1.8, the AF was very good.  No issues at all.Shoot \#2 was in day light shooting at ISO 100.  Again, everything was beautiful.Shoot \#3, at a dark museum.  On some items \(very large well lit\) exhibits, it was fine, but as soon as there was anything with a reflection, the lens failed.  this was mostly with my 80\-200mm f\/2.8 AF\-D lens.Another thought, RAW files are HUGE on this \- damn near 30 MB...\*\*\*\*\*Update \#3\*\*\*\*Hold everything.  I found 10 oil spots on my sensor.  At first I thought it was 3, but it\'s all over the place mostly around the left and top.  What a piece of garbage.Update \#4Nikon is not answering emails, phones, nor tweets. Nice.Update \#5Nikon finally decided to answer their phone. Smuggy woman who answered the phone said there were no widespread problems with the D600 and told me not to believe my own eyes nor the eyes of many others.  She ignored all the links and sample pictures I sent and refused to send a shipping label.  All she offered was to send me to a link to send the camera in but then I\'d have to pay for shipping.  6 pounds, across the country, fully insured is about \$60.  I\'m sending it to BH now to see if the replacement will work.Update \#6, BH \(which has GREAT customer service by the way in case amazon doesn\'t work out for you for various reasons \*cough\* sales tax\) Sent me the replacement and that too had dust.Before sending it back to Nikon, I gave the replacement a dusting with the blower rocket and also canned air and it looked as if it blew most of the dust away.  This time at least it was only dust.\*\*Final update\*\*It is now 4\-19\-2013 and I have owned this camera since October of 2012.  So all in all, it\'s been 6 months.Throughout this time I\'ve had to clean the sensor 3 times.  1st time I did it myself, 2nd time I sent it in, and last time I just blew compressed air and it got everything.  That\'s just a fact of life with this camera.  I wish it wasn\'t, but it is and it seems like the dust issue becomes a minor thing after the initial cleanings.  I am also not happy that you can\'t change the aperture in live view mode.For the photographs however, this camera is superb.  Often in the past I would have to use fill flash in many situations just to try to balance light out but with this camera, the dynamic range is so high that I get away with lifting the shadows later.  The ISO performance is also insane.  I don\'t give using ISO 6400 a second thought.Final \(really final\) updateIt is now November 2013. The dust is still here and gotten worse.  It never goes away, it\'s like sensor herpes.  Nikon still hasn\'t admitted problems but they fixed the problems that don\'t exist by rolling out with the D610.  Thanks for nothing, Nikon.", negative
"Returned my one today.  It was a good camera until taking around 200 shots.  I love its D7000 style 39 focus points\; I love nikon low light sensor performance\; I love the light weight and awesome size\; but I have no choice to say goodbye to D600 due to dust, dust, and dust on the sensor.  It\'s not easy to stand on a \$2000 camera with on going increasing internal dust.  Yes, report saying dust will reduce after takin more than 3000 shots, but I cannot see the reason to suffer 3000 shots for the dust reducing.  What\'s the point to pay \$2000 camera with sensor dust issue and Nikon didn\'t take any action or have any plan to fix it.", negative

It was so bad that even on a cloudy day \(snow on the ground which I know doesn\'t help\) I had problems seeing the picture I was about to take.

"Excellent images, not on par with my Nikon D50, but took great pix.  I would prefer a viewfinder.  The screen is a little hard to see in bright light, and the delay for a flash picture can be annoying, but overall, what more could I ask for under \$100.", positive

"I did a lot of research and came to the conclusion that this camera offered me the most for the least amount of money.  I purchased for my wife\'s birthday and I wanted to get her a camera that was easy to use and took great pictures.  This product does just that.  not only does it take great pictures but also takes excellent video, up to an hour using the 16 GB memory card.  I own other canon products and have always been happy with there performance.  I was not disappointed with this camera.  It came as a bundle from Amazon, camera, 16 GB memory and case.  Great deal\!", positive

"The camera was very good. But when I bought the camera and the rest of the stuff. You told me it would cost me \$118.63\? When I payed my bill. After words there was another \$10.63 added on\? What was that for\? With all or the scams like with Target and all I would like to know what it was for\?  Thank You.", positive

"This was a Christmas gift for my husband. He doesn\'t like change so I wasn\'t sure he would give up his old bulky camera, but he did and loves this new one. It is small enough to take anywhere, the screen is a good size and the buttons are easy to operate. He likes to take videos and I love that there is a video button on the back of this camera.

"I purchased this camera to photograph our Christmas this year and it worked just described as an excellent deal for \$60.", positive
"My 6\-year\-old wanted a camera for Christmas but I didn\'t want to waste money on a \"kiddie\" version. I wanted something easy for her to use and understand, but one that she could use for years to come.  This camera fits the bill. Very simple to use. She can now take pictures, videos, and is able to review and delete all on her own. The quality of picture is what you would expect from a point and shoot camera. Happy with my purchase and so is she.", positive
"A lot of my friends can\'t believe how crisp the pictures are even in low light conditions.  I have taken crisp pictures of small birds utilizing the zoom function.  For a low end camera, it takes very good pictures.  It pays to read the manual AND experiment with the function settings.  For example, there is a setting for low light conditions \(which may trigger the flash\) but I have found that changing the ISP speed to 1600 can give nice clear pictures in low light without a flash.  It pays to experiment with this camera since the correct settings result in brilliant pictures.  One really needs to take a lot of pictures of one subject in the same setting to get a good idea how these settings work.  Once you grasp the proper settings, the pictures are excellent\!", positive
"fast shipment and wonderful camera to use.  Highly recommend this camera for it\'s price.  Was a perfect christmas gift to buy", positive

"Camera works great, easy to use. Clear and vivid pictures.When I purchased this camera on December 14th  the add also stated that it would come with a free memory card and case.  You were to click on the card and case to add to the order.  I did that.  I did not receive either one.  When I called Amazon the young man I spoke to asked his supervisor about it.  The supervisor stated that It was not an option on the add.  I said I didn\'t expect it to be on there now since the camera dropped in price.  However, that\'s what was offered when I purchased it.  I also advised them to check the reviews, I was not the only one with this complaint.  Just out of luck I guess\!\!\!", positive
"I was looking for a small easy to use camera. I saw this one and it met all my needs. I\'ve only had it a short time but it takes beautiful clear pictures. Very easy  to use and handle. I love it and would tell people to buy", positive

"This was purchased .as a gift for my youngest grandson. I tested it first charged the battery inserted the SDHC card and took several pictures. I liked the unit, small light weight great pictures. And the grandson was very surprised and excited about it. I rate it a Good buy at a good price.", positive
"If you are a novice picture as I am, why buy anything else\? Drawback\: it is difficult for me to hold the clip lever open while I am inserting the memory card. That is because I have a damaged left hand. I had to get a lady neighbor with long fingernails to insert mine. Smile\!", positive
"This is the first camera I have owned in many years and it fits in my pocket so I can have quick access. It came with a cover which I truly appreciate. When I move the focus sometimes I end up with grainy pictures or blurry and for some reason it takes a few extra seconds to focus. I have missed some good shots because of that.  Another problem I had was not realizing what I clicked on that caused multiple shots and that was strange. I am still not sure how I fixed it either. However, overall for me and my qualifications, this is a good buy.", positive
"As usual, canon comes thru with a great little fill in camera. This is the second one and we love it", positive

"This was a gift and the camera is very good for the low price I got it for. The pictures are nice.", positive
"I love that I have a camera again\; this is more sophisticated than my previous camera, better focus, more user friendly, lighter and I love having a battery to recharge instead of having to buy double A batteries. What really chafes me, though, is that I had to pay \$16 for a cable to upload photos to my computer \-\- Kodak gave you one with the camera purchase, and I think it\'s kind of cheesy for Canon not to supply one. BTW, the one I got was at Staples, someone said it had to be one made by Canon, not true, this works perfectly. I was lucky to find this when Amazon was running a deal where you got the memory card for free, I expect to have to pay for the memory card, but not the cable.", positive
"Bought this for my granddaughter\'s 11th birthday.  She loves it\!\!  It\'s a very nice camera for not a lot of money.  She showed me photos and videos that she\'s taken of the dogs playing and sleeping\!  Small size makes it easy to slip into a pocket\-\-perfect for a trip to Disney World or any vacation.", positive

"Got here as promise before Christmas. Very happy with it... now we have to figure out how to work it. But hubby was happy so am I...it was to him from Santa\! Thank you, Gail", positive
"I just love my Canon PowerShot... It is small but powerful.  It takes wonderful pictures and the detail is awesome.  It is easy to use.  I would recommend this camera to anyone.", positive
"This camera is a little slower than my 8MP Canon \-\- but, the pictures are so well defined that you can crop a picture \(taken from 100 yards away\) and it isn\'t blurry when enlarged.  I like this camera \-\- easier to adjust the distance than my other Canon.", positive
"My wife is a teacher and needed a small camera to capture those special moments in her classroom. This camera fits in her purse and takes great pictures. She seems to be very happy with it.", positive
"Because it is great my grandma used to use a wind up camera and it used to make a lot of noise and know it is quiet at all of our activities", positive
"This camera is wonderful. I am enjoying my camera very much. It takes really good pictures and videos. Great buy", positive
"I would start by saying this is a very good \"cheap\" camera. It is ideal for novice users, or anyone who wants good vacation shots and is not a snob about cameras. It takes very high quality pictures and 720P HD video and is very easy and intuitive. It has nice big screen to look at picture and video you have taken and it interface with your pad or PC via USB or by SD card. The camera requires, but does not come with an SD card. I bought the 64gb card and it is my understanding this is the maximum this camera can use. It has 5x zoom which is not awesome, but adequate for the casual user.  Underwater housings are also available for this camera. For the price, \(\$69.00 using Amazon Prime\) you cannot do better. This is vastly superior to my previous powershot.  It is an excellent bang for your buck and I love the size and quality for average use.", positive
"One of the best deals I got for this Thanksgiving\! The camera is easy to use. And I cannot trust Cannon more on its great color.", positive
"I got this for my Granddaughter because she loved to use mine every time she came here.  It is a great point and shoot.  Takes super pictures and is very easy to use\!\!", positive
"I asked for this as a Christmas gift and am SO happy I did.  I am a professional photographer and wanted something small to put in my pocket and take to the park with my kids...my DSLR is big and bulky.  I fiddled with the camera for a while and was thinking it might be okay, but I would likely not use it much.  Then I turned off the flash and turned on the vibration control.  Now I LOVE it\!  It takes great pictures, even indoors without a flash.  I am quite impressed and would highly recommend this camera.", positive
"Its small but gets the job done was surprized it had panaramic on it ive always like that feature gave it as christmas gift reciever was happy used it same day but it doesnt come with a case,sd card . Takes good pictures", positive
"IT TAKES PICTURES. IT FITS IN MY MASSIVE HANDS. I INSIST THAT THIS IS RED, NOT PINK. VERY EXTREMELY SATISFIED.", positive
"If you are not professional like me but love take good pictures, that\'s the camera. Amazing\!\!\! For the price was the best deal ever. Se voc\Ãª n\Ã£o \Ã© processional, mas ama tirar \Ã³timas fotos, essa \Ã© a c\Ã¢mera. Incr\Ã­vel\!\!\! Pelo pre\Ã§o, foi um \Ã³timo neg\Ã³cio. Vale a pena.", positive
"This was a Christmas gift and loved the moment it was opened.  I think it has been put down only long enough to recharge the battery.", positive

"I had ordered everything to make a nice gift. The only thing that came was the camera. It was to be gift wrapped as is all the rest of my order. The camera was shrink wrapped to a piece of cardboard and my note was glued to the outside of the shipping box. I went out and bought a Scan Disc memory card and had a charged battery to fit. My wife was trying to learn how to use her new camera tonight. She asked about the caring case and extra memory card and battery and charger and I told her they had not arrived. I have been in contact wit 2 reps. of Amazon . com and they assured me that I would have the rest of my order the 23 and 24th. I would only hope that they are wrapped like a gift and my card put inside the box. Please make this a good gift as she will be going on a family trip right after Christmas day.  Thanks for the help Romone, I known you are doing your best to please this old man. Merry Christmas.  Gary Maurer", positive

I am finally going to get some great photos\! This camera is amazing for the price. It\'s like having a more expensive camera that fits in the palm of your hand\! GREAT BUY\!\!\! AAA\+\+\+\+\+", positive

"I do a lot of photography, own a lot of cameras including pricey ones by NIKON \(7100\) and CANON \(G10\)  and LUMIX \(LX7\) and SAMSUNG \(GALAXY\). I also own and use a lot two CANON POWERSHOT A4000 IS, for which I paid just over \$100 each. Has the \"DIGIC 4\" chip used in many of their best DSLR cameras, a 3\" display, 8X optical and 8X digital zoom. The review is about the A2500, the little brother to the 4000. It also has the DIGIC 4 chip \(that\'s something important, one smart brain in this box\). It has a 28mm wide angle as does the A4000. It has only a 5X optical, 5X digital zoom. The \"IS\" stands for Intelligent systems, and while BOTH cameras take awesome pictures and represent for normal folks super deals that will keep up with the far more expensive cameras \(like those listed above\) for normal use, the A4000 IS deals with tricky lighting and the outer margins of early morning, late evening, backlit scenes, and so on, better than the A2500. BOTH are super deals. My tired eyes appreciate that larger display on the somewhat more expensive A4000 IS. I also like to \"crop tight\" meaning I really zoom in. That again is a slight advantage to the A4000 IS. If photography isn\'t a passion, either will do a great job. If you spend a few \$\$\$ more the A4000 will give you that difference back over the years in quality shots under tougher situations.", positive
"very good product fulfilled with my expectations I had with it, I look forward to doing future business with you, thank you very much ....", positive
"I brought this camera for my wife who has trouble with camera settings. She loves how simplistic and easy it is to use the camera. Separate buttons for picture taking and video eliminates mistakes, and the camera takes very good pictures espcially for its price. She likes how light weight the camera is and also the charging case for the battery that doesn\'t have a cumbersome cord.", positive
"I purchased this camera on the recommendation of a friend who has an earlier model and is a professional photographer. It is exactly what I wanted and needed. I absolutely love it for its great, clear pictures and ease of use. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a light\-weight, simple camera. I purchased a Canon because of the great results from previous Canons that I have owned. My last Canon wasn\'t working properly and I was unable to get replacement parts to due to its age, so this was a great replacement product.", positive
"Camera takes perfect pictures and is perfect size.  Take it everywhere.  All pictures are very clear and the camera is so easy to use", positive
"Does what it said it would, good value for the money.Fairly sturdy\- already been dropped a couple of times.Good battery life. Good quality of the pictures, but I\'m not an expert, there.Took me a while to find the \" Delete all pictures\" in the menu options. Wish the choice was made easier wirth the trash can icon on the front.", positive
"I purchased this camera because of the size. It will come in handy hunting from a tree stand. Very small, light weight, and simple.", positive
"We bought this for our 12 year old to have at Christmas as her first camera.  It is really easy to use and has been a great camera and was a great price.  Nothing fancy, which is exactly what we wanted.", positive
"It is easy to use. Point and shoot. The pictures are good, even though we are unskilled. Recommend buying backup batteries. The 600mAh battery doesn\'t last a full day of hard use.I was surprised that the case was as efficient as it was. I expected a 3\/4 opening to be a challenge but it was the perfect size to hold the camera in place when unzipped. Attach the carabiner to your belt loop. Slip the camera in the case with the wrist strap outside the case. Zip the case closed. Now the wrist strap can be used when removing the camera. It\'s reassuring to have the strap first.", positive
"Bought these for my two sisters....good price and they are happy with the product.  One sister bought the same one for a friend that never had a digital camera before and he is working it with no problem....didn\'t know it came with no SD card though \!", positive
"This camera is fantastic, just what I wanted. It is the best camera I have now. It takes great pictures.", positive
"Seeing so many reviews with low ratings because people aren\'t reviewing properly. Review the actual product, when you complain about amazon or if it didn\'t come with a case or sd  card, that doesn\'t educate a buyer on the camera\'s performance. I see an overall star rating, and I\'m sometimes pushed away from a product because people are upset about things included in a sale. I want to know if the camera takes good pictures or how long the battery will last and people are rating it a 1,2,3 star because they are upset over accessory details and never even rate the actual camera. If you not happy with a purchase, send it  back, don\'t rate the camera a 1 star without even mentioning it, such as this review now has little merit on the camera.", positive
"We like this and the Elf version so much we have now bought another one for our second child. Great, easy to use camera that comes in a fun color and won\'t disappoint a 5\-10 year old new camera user who also wants to take videos...but will also please the adult user who just wants a no\-fuss compact digital camera with HD Video capability to tuck into a purse, pocket or bag for ease of use over a larger DSLR camera outfit. Bonous on our order of this product this time \= it came with a free SD Card\! Pairing it up with a CoreLogic slim case and it\'s a great Santa Gift for our child\!", positive

"This camera shipped in one day and got here the next LOVE this camera great pictured have been hung in my wall because of this high quality camera", positive
"It\'s a solid camera and does what we needed. Wanted a small camera to take to parties that didn\'t cost to much so if it got lost or broken no biggy.", positive
"I love Canon.  I had an A2300, and needed to replace it, so I went with a model as similar as possible.  This model has built\-in  instructions, so you don\'t HAVE to have a manual.  The photos are great for my applications.  I didn\'t realize it came WITHOUT a memory card \(gee, I thought I was getting a GREAT price\) so I was delayed in getting started with it.  Overall, though, I would highly recommend this camera.", positive
"Like many other owners of this camera, I downloaded the manual onto my iPad2 home screen rather than print the 100\-plus pages. There are many functions to discover and implement\-\-including a self\-timer, and the iPad makes it convenient to learn the functions, even when I am waiting at the doctor\'s office. That being said, I still have not learned all the functions because the numerous icons therein are like learning a foreign language. But I AM learning them little by little.Because I am a beginner with digital cameras, I am using the most\-basic functions first, such as using auto\-focus pretty nearly exclusively to help me become familiar with the camera. So far so good, and I truly enjoy using the camera and printing the photos, which have all come out to my satisfaction. Getting back to the manual\:  This 100\-plus page manual is packed with information making this camera surprisingly high\-tech for such a compact camera. Without the manual to describe and explain all the functions, I doubt that I would enjoy this camera as much as I do. And the camera price is extremely reasonable, as is that of the case that protects it well.As for having to buy a memory card, as one reviewer pointed out, when we used to buy NEW film cameras we did not expect to receive a free roll of film with it.USB cable not included\! either\! but check the online manual and you may find it listed under \"Optional Accessories.\"", positive
"Fast power up, fewer missed shots. Rechargable batteries can be quickly swapped out \( buy more than one\). Small enough to fit a purse or pocket. I really enjoy the features of this camera. Digital photos enlarge to 8x10 easily, without loss of crispness.", positive

"loved it loved it loved it. everything was perfect . no scratches and everything was working. my daughter loved her birthday gift", positive
"This is a great camera for anyone who wants to give it as a gift to a person who may not be familiar with digital cameras and the basics of photography. The camera is extremely easy to use and simple menus and controls make it very easy for someone who maybe doesn\'t have the best familiarity with electronics or cameras in general. Highly recommend\!", positive

"I got this to replace a Sony point and shoot camera that started taking somewhat lousy photographs through no fault of my own. It\'s great for events where a more professional camera would be a hassle to carry, but a cell phone camera would be lacking. I used it at a meet and greet after a concert, and it took excellent photos of the artist and me. I used it recently to snap some photos of Christmas lights, and I was pleased at the quality. It\'s a great budget camera, with a small zoom, but it takes great photos.FYI, some people complained because it doesn\'t contain a USB transfer cable, it\'s easier to just take the SD card out and put it directly in your computer to transfer photos.", positive
"I decided to buy this camera for the great\'s reviews and comments from other customers. I though that it was a great opportunity to get my first camera \(as the offer said that you would get some items free with the purchased of some camera listed\), and really it was. Finally I got the camera which meets all my expectations. But I though that memory card and the Amazon basics compact camera case will be sent with my purchase, since the offer said that those items came free with my purchase \(Cannon Powershot A2500\). I have a chat with a Customer representative \(Manisha\) and now they are going to send me the items that I did not received previously. Thanks Amazon for your understanding.  Thanks for your support.", positive

It is so small and cute, light weight and takes out such clean and crisp pictures and it is easy to use. It is not complicated like some other digital cameras. All the steps are one after the other at the touch of your thumb. This is not a professional camera but can be used for those who like to travel whether home or abroad or just to have fun pics. I love it and would recommend it to you.", positive
"My answer to this is somewhat paradoxical in that once you have figured out all of the complexities of the menu functions and how to set it up...it becomes one of the best quality and easily operated digital cameras of its kind. Simply as advice to the prospective buyer I would hardily advise you to purchase its case and a good high quality \(\#10\) Flash Memory Card with this camera. Even though it functions extremely well and is quite competitive with higher priced cameras it is small and delicate in nature. sms", positive

There have been numerous times that we\'ve seen something that would be a wonderful picture but we didn\'t have the camera with us.

"I love the Canon series of digital cameras. This is the fourth one of the several that I have purchased over several years, because I have purchased them as presents for my grown kids. This one has 16 megapixels, and it takes great photos of things that are moving. I took a photo that included the TV in the shot, and the close up showed the picture on the screen of the TV perfectly.  I have a slight tremor in my hands, and I can take good pictures using this camera despite this. I have also been known to accidentally drop my camera, even though I try to use a lanyard around my neck to secure it. So far, even with dropping it, my older Canon camera hasn\'t needed to be repaired.", positive

"I am no photographer.  But my work takes me all over the world.  I could not kill my 5 year old pocket cannon \- It took took excellent photos even tho the back viewer quit working.  But the viewfinder worked so I kept snapping.  I finally broke down and purchased this one for a trip to Scotland.  1\/2 half the weight and twice as many pixels as my old one.

What a great deal\!", positive
"tiny and easy to carry in your pocket, takes great photos, I uploaded some for everyone to see ... the only thing is that when you push the button, it takes time till the camera clicks, so if your cat moves, till it clicks, the cat is gone. but what you want for 68 bucks\? a leica\? it is a marvel of the modern technology for this tiny price and here is a video i took in sunny california few days ago with this camera while driving in a car, the video and audio is greathttps\:\/\/archive.org\/details\/MVI0488", positive

However, I found the camera very easy to use, and I LOVE IT\!My main reason for purchasing this camera over others is for the rechargeable battery.

I like that it fits in the palm of your hand, the battery lasts and lasts, the videos I took were crisp and sharp, and the price was the best deal in town. It is perfect for any occasion, and the accessory transfer cable not only acts as a charger, but allows me to transfer my pictures to my photo program without having to open the camera and remove the SD card. Not fancy, but practical for the price.", positive

"I am happy to comment regarding the camera.  It is very easy to use and light weight.  I purchased it as a graduation gift and my grandson and the rest of the family are enjoying it.  However, there was one problem.  The cord to connect to the computer was not included in the package and I had already given it to my grandson.  He needed it right away so I could not return it.  Other than that, they are very satisfied.Thank you for your kind attention.Respectfully submitted,Frances E. Priester", positive

"This is my 6th point and shoot \(P\&S\) camera in 9 years, ranging in price from \$200\-\$300. I have had 1 Bell \& Howell, 3 Nikons and this is my 2nd Canon P\&S camera. The last 2 P\&S cameras I had I literally wore out by taking so many pictures. I bought this as a second camera for my husband \(who doesn\'t usually take pictures\) to use when he goes hunting with my son. I chose a Canon because I have a Canon DSLR and love it. I also wanted an inexpensive camera, because I thought it would sit on the shelf for most of the year. Of course it did not come with a memory card, as I have yet to buy any camera that does.To test this camera, after shooting indoors for a bit, I took it to the park. Luckily, what started out as a sunny day turned cloudy, allowing me to test the camera in different lighting. This is a typical low priced P\&S camera.  Like all P\&S cameras, this one performs best in bright, outdoor lighting. However, the ease of use and quality of pictures for the small price tag makes this a good buy. This is one of the better P\&S cameras I have had.Although no instruction manual was in the box \(other than the very basics\), it was easy to figure out how to manually set this camera, which is a must for me. I liked the fact that it has a PROGRAM setting, which allows me to set a program manually. Even if I switch to another setting, it saves my manual settings, allowing me to switch back and forth between settings. That was great when I tested it, because the lighting went from sunny to cloudy and back again. I could easily switch from AUTO to LANDSCAPE to PROGRAM \(my manually programmed settings\) and back, depending on lighting and activity, all while holding my 6 month old. The pictures I took while holding my baby \(who was trying to grab the camera\) of my 4 other children who were riding a moving train turned out surprisingly good. I also manually adjusted the ISO to 1600 and took some shots while holding my squirming baby, and the pictures were not as noisy as I thought they would be.This is a great camera for the price. I would definitely recommend it for anyone, especially those who are ready to do some manual adjustments to get better pictures, but not ready to spend a lot of money. I am glad I bought this camera, and I am happy because I think I will actually use it more than I originally thought\!", positive
"I am a fan of Canon Camera\'s, and have an older version of the Canon Rebel. However although I really bought this camera for my wife, I do enjoy taking it with me when I am out myself. It is easy to slip into the pocket, and quick to get ready to take a photo. The quality of the photos is brilliant. The colors are so vivid, and real. The Auto\-focus is perhaps the best that I have seen is a compact digital camera. The screen shows what points the camera is focusing on, so you know instantly your subject is in focus \- of it you need to re\-frame your image.Most importantly the actual photo taking is quick. Some digital cameras will blur when the subject moves at the point the photo is taking, because of the delay in processing the photo onto your memory card. I\'ve not had any such problems with this camera.I would recommend this camera to serious photographers who, like me just like to carry a camera everywhere they go. Or as a 1st camera for someone new to digital photography.", positive
"We love our canon PowerShot A2500 Digital Camera.  It is very compact, light, but works like the big camera\'s.  It takes great pictures, the zoom feature is fantastic and photo\'s can be easily downloaded to your computer.  For the value, this is an exceptional camera.", positive

"i bought the powershot for a class reunion weekend and it excelled\! it gave me several hundred of the nicest photos i\'ve ever taken and i cant wait to take it out and take some more photos\! a couple videos too that also was very easy to do. what i really like about the powershot is you can SEE the photos right as you take it,  so say one was blurry due to new user error. it shows you the photo and you can say right away \" nope try again\"  that was VERY handy along with showing people thier photos in case they wanted a try \#2. same with erasing very easy.before i bought this i knew nothing about Digital cameras, the last one i had was a film camera ten years ago. so this was my first digital camera purchase, and what a brilliant purchase it was, the amazon reviews and basic instructions were enough to know what i need and how use it, you must have a photo memory card \( not sent with the camera so when it says do you want the package YES you do\!\)  and you must charge the battery beforehand and check it, if you are away from home make sure you take the battery charger and if you\'ve used it alot check the battery i forgot to do that and the third night i couldnt take photos. it warned me.. i just thought.. nah.. it will be okay. \( nope but once it charged it was fine\) but not only was it easy for me to take clear wonderful photos of my reunion weekend, it was easy for my friends taking photos with it too to just use it as well.  the automatic sensing flash was nice too. the digital uploads of the photos \( with separate purchase of the cable\) also could not have been easier. i also liked the little bag that came with the package. it had a nice belt clip. also if i didnt have a belt loop it was very easy to tuck in my pocket and not have to schlump a large camera and case along. it was dropped by accident on a hardwood floor and kept on going with no problems.  everybody went oh no\! and i was like nope\! its good\! say cheese\!the price couldnt have been nicer also.. very pleased with my new Canon Powershot\!", positive

After serious thinking and seeing reviews, I decided to go with the Cannon PowerShot. I gambled with the Bad reviews, and it payed off. A great buy, and awesome camera. I have NO complaints with this camera. I figure that the bad reviews on this were either people who don\'t like Canon, or they received a camera that was wonky directly from the factory. No complaints with this camera. My dad loves it, it takes awesome pictures. Definitely a good buy.", positive
"The only problem is that there is no manual for it...online or otherwise...but it is simple enough that I figured it out. It takes awesome low light pictures", positive

"As a long time Canon compact camera user my favorite new features on the A2500 are...The Canon PowerShot A2500 does not just stop at taking images but is rather adept at handling videos as well. It is capable of producing 720p HD files at the touch of a button. One of the thoughtful things about this camera is the inclusion of the movie button. You do not have to fidget about with all sorts of controls in order to get the video going. Rather you go back to that simple button and the rest is history.Another nice feature is that this product is newly minted with an ECO mode which is designed to reduce the power consumption on your camera.The Canon brand has made cameras its specialty and the Canon PowerShot A2500 holds true to type. This model brings out all the features that you would expect of a camera of its class but has the added advantage of making it easier for the consumer to access those features. In other words you get the best of both worlds with a great camera and easy usage.Verdict\:There are no major surprises with the Canon PowerShot A2500. It is a great camera that does what it says on the box.If you are looking for the next model up check out the Canon SD330 as it has another level of features and quality.http\:\/\/www.amazon.com\/gp\/product\/B00B5HE3UU\/ref\=as\_li\_ss\_tl\?ie\=UTF8\&camp\=1789\&creative\=390957\&creativeASIN\=B00B5HE3UU\&linkCode\=as2\&tag\=stupisms\-20", positive
