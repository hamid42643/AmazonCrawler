"To keep the heart unwrinkled, to be hopeful, kindly, cheerful, reverent - that is to triumph over old age.", Age

"Iran has long sponsored terrorists who carry out homicide bombings in Israeli cities. However, it is a mistake to believe the danger Iran poses is directed at Israel alone.", Alone
"Neutrinos alone, among all the known particles, have ethereal properties that are striking and romantic enough both to have inspired a poem by John Updike and to have sent teams of scientists deep underground for 50 years to build huge science-fiction-like contraptions to unravel their mysteries.", Alone

"I\'m vulnerable to criticism. Any artist is, because you work alone in your studio and, until recently, critics were the only way you\'d get any feedback.", Alone

"Those who look for the laws of Nature as a support for their new works collaborate with the creator.", Architecture
"Architecture is the learned game, correct and magnificent, of forms assembled in the light.", Architecture

"Not many architects have the luxury to reject significant things.", Architecture
"But I absolutely believe that architecture is a social activity that has to do with some sort of communication or places of interaction, and that to change the environment is to change behaviour.", Architecture

"The bungalow had more to do with how Americans live today than any other building that has gone remotely by the name of architecture in our history.", Architecture
"No architect troubled to design houses that suited people who were to live in them, because that would have meant building a whole range of different houses. It was far cheaper and, above all, timesaving to make them identical.", Architecture
"Don\'t clap too hard - it\'s a very old building.", Architecture
"As architects we are often involved in the concrete-steel-and-glass aspect of it, but cities are social structures, and to be involved in imagining the future of cities and the type of relationships and the types of places that we\'re making is something that intrigues me very much.", Architecture
"Color in certain places has the great value of making the outlines and structural planes seem more energetic.", Architecture
"I\'m often called an old-fashioned modernist. But the modernists had the absurd idea that architecture could heal the world. That\'s impossible. And today nobody expects architects to have these grand visions any more.", Architecture

"The architecture of our future is not only unfinished; the scaffolding has hardly gone up.", Architecture
"My mother studied English and drama at the University of Pennsylvania, where my father studied architecture. She was a great influence in all sorts of ways, a wicked wit.", Architecture
"First, there is the bare beauty of the logs themselves with their long lines and firm curves. Then there is the open charm felt of the structural features which are not hidden under plaster and ornament, but are clearly revealed, a charm felt in Japanese architecture.", Architecture
"Architecture theory is very interesting.", Architecture
"The loftier the building, the deeper must the foundation be laid.", Architecture
"It is not the beauty of a building you should look at; its the construction of the foundation that will stand the test of time.", Architecture
"But the building\'s identity resided in the ornament.", Architecture
"To work in architecture you are so much involved with society, with politics, with bureaucrats. It\'s a very complicated process to do large projects. You start to see the society, how it functions, how it works. Then you have a lot of criticism about how it works.", Architecture
"Form follows function.", Architecture
"My house is my refuge, an emotional piece of architecture, not a cold piece of convenience.", Architecture
"Architecture, of all the arts, is the one which acts the most slowly, but the most surely, on the soul.", Architecture

"An artist never really finishes his work, he merely abandons it.", Art
"All art is but imitation of nature.", Art
"If we could but paint with the hand what we see with the eye.", Art

"The strangeness will wear off and I think we will discover the deeper meanings in modern art.", Art

"Fashion is only the attempt to realize art in living forms and social intercourse.", Art
"The terrifying and edible beauty of Art Nouveau architecture.", Art

"Great art picks up where nature ends.", Art
"A sad fact of life lately at the Museum of Modern Art is that when it comes to group shows of contemporary painting from the collection, the bar has been set pretty low.", Art
"The alchemy of good curating amounts to this: Sometimes, placing one work of art near another makes one plus one equal three. Two artworks arranged alchemically leave each intact, transform both, and create a third thing.", Art
"Everyone goes to the same exhibitions and the same parties, stays in the same handful of hotels, eats at the same no-star restaurants, and has almost the same opinions. I adore the art world, but this is copycat behavior in a sphere that prides itself on independent thinking.", Art
"Mission accomplished. The Museum of Modern Art\'s wide-open, tall-ceilinged, super-reinforced second floor was for all intents and purposes built to accommodate monumental installations and gigantic sculptures, should the need arise. It has arisen.", Art
"\'Summer of Love: Art of the Psychedelic Era,\' the Whitney Museum\'s 40th-anniversary trip down counterculture memory lane, provides moments of buzzy fun, but it\'ll leave you only comfortably numb. For starters, it may be the whitest, straightest, most conservative show seen in a New York museum since psychedelia was new.", Art
"I love to collect modern art.", Art
"Those who love him love that he sells the most art; they take it as a point of faith that this proves Kinkade is the best. But his fans don\'t only rely on this supply-and-demand justification. They go back to values.", Art
"The reason the art world doesn\'t respond to Kinkade is because none - not one - of his ideas about subject-matter, surface, color, composition, touch, scale, form, or skill is remotely original. They\'re all cliche and already told.", Art
"Kinkade\'s paintings are worthless schmaltz, and the lamestream media that love him are wrong. However, I\'d love to see a museum mount a small show of Kinkade\'s work. I would like the art world and the wider world to argue about him in public, out in the open.", Art
"Auction houses run a rigged game. They know exactly how many people will be bidding on a work and exactly who they are. In a gallery, works of art need only one person who wants to pay for them.", Art
"Artschwager\'s art always involves looking closely at surfaces, questions what an object is, wants to make you forget the name of the thing you\'re looking at so that it might mushroom in your mind into something that triggers unexpected infinities.", Art
"Early-twentieth-century abstraction is art\'s version of Einstein\'s Theory of Relativity. It\'s the idea that changed everything everywhere: quickly, decisively, for good.", Art
"The Metropolitan Museum of Art is unsurpassed at presenting more than 50 centuries of work. I go there constantly, seeing things over and over, better than I\'ve ever seen them before.", Art
"If the Frieze Art Fair catches on, I imagine at least two great things happening. First, we will once again have a huge art fair in town that isn\'t too annoying to go to. More importantly, Frieze may finally show New Yorkers that we can cross our own waters for visual culture. That would change everything.", Art
"Art is for anyone. It just isn\'t for everyone. Still, over the past decade, its audience has hugely grown, and that\'s irked those outside the art world, who get irritated at things like incomprehensibility or money.", Art
"I often find myself privately stewing about much British art, thinking that except for their tremendous gardens, that the English are not primarily visual artists, and are, in nearly unsurpassable ways, literary.", Art
"A metaphysical tour de force of untethered meaning and involuting interlocking contrapuntal rhythms, \'The Clock\' is more than a movie or even a work of art. It is so strange and other-ish that it becomes a stream-of-consciousness algorithm unto itself - something almost inhuman.", Art
"I don\'t know much about auctions. I sometimes go to previews and see art sardined into ugly rooms. I\'ve gawked at the gaudy prices, and gaped at well-clad crowds of happy white people conspicuously spending hundreds of millions of dollars.", Art
"I love art dealers. In some ways, they\'re my favorite people in the art world. Really. I love that they put their money where their taste is, create their own aesthetic universes, support artists, employ people, and do all of this while letting us see art for free. Many are visionaries.", Art
"When museums are built these days, architects, directors, and trustees seem most concerned about social space: places to have parties, eat dinner, wine-and-dine donors. Sure, these are important these days - museums have to bring in money - but they gobble up space and push the art itself far away from the entrance.", Art
"I see 30 to 40 gallery shows a week, and no matter what kind of mood I\'m in, no matter how bad the art is, I almost always feel better afterward. I can learn as much from bad art as from good.", Art
"Jeffrey Deitch is the Jeff Koons of art dealers. Not because he\'s the biggest, best, or the richest of his kind. But because in some ways he\'s the weirdest (which is saying a lot when you\'re talking about the wonderful, wicked, lovable, and annoying creatures known as art dealers).", Art
"Many say an art dealer running a museum is a \'conflict of interest.\' But maybe the art world has lived an artificial or unintentional lie all of these years when it comes to conflicts of interest.", Art
"Of course art world ethics are important. But museums are no purer than any other institution or business. Academics aren\'t necessarily more high-minded than gallerists.", Art

"The basis of art is truth, both in matter and in mode.", Art
"Art is one thing that can go on mattering once it has stopped hurting.", Art
"Of course the illusion of art is to make one believe that great literature is very close to life, but exactly the opposite is true. Life is amorphous, literature is formal.", Art
"I\'m very manipulative towards directors. My theory is that everyone on the set is directing the film, we\'re all receiving art messages from the universe on how we should do the film.", Art
"I\'m very much into the costuming of any character that I portray and it\'s one of the great things about making movies is it\'s a collaborative art form so you get all these artists who are looking specifically about for this instance your character\'s costume and what that might tell about your character.", Art
"Writing stopped being fun when I discovered the difference between good writing and bad and, even more terrifying, the difference between it and true art. And after that, the whip came down.", Art
"It\'s important to debunk the myths of Africa being this benighted continent civilized only when white people arrived. In fact, Africans had been creators of culture for thousands of years before. These were very intelligent, subtle and sophisticated people, with organized societies and great art.", Art

"The greatest work of art about New York? The question seems nebulous. The city\'s magic and majesty are distilled in the photographs of Alfred Stieglitz and Paul Strand.", Art
"Abstract Expressionism - the first American movement to have a worldwide influence - was remarkably short-lived: It heated up after World War II and was all but done for by 1960 (although visit any art school today and you\'ll find a would-be Willem de Kooning).", Art
"My culture-deprived, aspirational mother dragged me once a month from our northern suburb - where the word art never came up - to the Art Institute of Chicago. I hated it.", Art
"I\'m noticing a new approach to art making in recent museum and gallery shows. It flickered into focus at the New Museum\'s \'Younger Than Jesus\' last year and ran through the Whitney Biennial, and I\'m seeing it blossom and bear fruit at \'Greater New York,\' MoMA P.S. 1\'s twice-a-decade extravaganza of emerging local talent.", Art
"Outside museums, in noisy public squares, people look at people. Inside museums, we leave that realm and enter what might be called the group-mind, getting quiet to look at art.", Art
"It took the Metropolitan Museum of Art nearly 50 years to wake up to Pablo Picasso. It didn\'t own one of his paintings until 1946, when Gertrude Stein bequeathed that indomitable quasi-Cubistic picture of herself - a portrait of the writer as a sumo Buddha - to the Met, principally because she disliked the Museum of Modern Art.", Art
"Appropriation is the idea that ate the art world. Go to any Chelsea gallery or international biennial and you\'ll find it. It\'s there in paintings of photographs, photographs of advertising, sculpture with ready-made objects, videos using already-existing film.", Art
"After its hothouse incubation in the seventies, appropriation breathed important new life into art. This life flowered spectacularly over the decades - even if it\'s now close to aesthetic kudzu.", Art
"The New York art world readily proves people wrong. Just when folks say that things stink and flibbertigibbet critics wish the worst on us all because we\'re not pure enough, good omens appear.", Art
"Artistic qualities that once seemed undeniable don\'t seem so now. Sometimes these fluctuations are only fickleness of taste, momentary glitches in an artist\'s work, or an artist getting ahead of his audience (it took me ten years to catch up to Albert Oehlen). Other times, however, these problems mean there\'s something wrong with the art.", Art
"Can space break? I mean the space of art galleries. Over the past 100 years, art galleries have gone from looking like Beaux Arts salons to simple storefronts to industrial lofts to the gleaming giant white cubes of Chelsea with their shiny concrete floors.", Art
"It\'s great that New York has large spaces for art. But the enormous immaculate box has become a dated, even oppressive place. Many of these spaces were designed for sprawling installations, large paintings, and the Relational Aesthetics work of the past fifteen years.", Art
"The giant white cube is now impeding rather than enhancing the rhythms of art. It preprograms a viewer\'s journey, shifts the emphasis from process to product, and lacks individuality and openness. It\'s not that art should be seen only in rutty bombed-out environments, but it should seem alive.", Art
"It\'s art that pushes against psychological and social expectations, that tries to transform decay into something generative, that is replicative in a baroque way, that isn\'t about progress, and wants to - as Walt Whitman put it - \'contain multitudes.\'", Art
"Much good art got made while money ruled; I like a lot of it, and hardship and poverty aren\'t virtues. The good news is that, since almost no one will be selling art, artists - especially emerging ones - won\'t have to think about turning out a consistent style or creating a brand. They\'ll be able to experiment as much as they want.", Art
"When money and hype recede from the art world, one thing I won\'t miss will be what curator Francesco Bonami calls the \'Eventocracy.\' All this flashy \'art-fair art\' and those highly produced space-eating spectacles and installations wow you for a minute until you move on to the next adrenaline event.", Art
"A saboteur in the house of art and a comedienne in the house of art theory, Lawler has spent three decades documenting the secret life of art. Functioning as a kind of one-woman CSI unit, she has photographed pictures and objects in collectors\' homes, in galleries, on the walls of auction houses, and off the walls, in museum storage.", Art
"Works of art often last forever, or nearly so. But exhibitions themselves, especially gallery exhibitions, are like flowers; they bloom and then they die, then exist only as memories, or pressed in magazines and books.", Art
"If only we could persuade galleries to observe a fallow period in which, for two months every other year, new and old works of art could be sold in back rooms and all main galleries would be devoted to revisiting shows gone by.", Art
"A canon is antithetical to everything the New York art world has been about for the past 40 years, during which we went from being the center of the art world to being one of many centers.", Art
"It took me twenty years to get Steven Parrino\'s work. From the time I first saw his art, in the mid-eighties, I almost always dismissed it as mannered, Romantic, formulaic, conceptualist-formalist heavy-metal boy-art abstraction.", Art
"\'Untitled\' is a time machine that can transport you to 1992, an edgy moment when the art world was crumbling, money was scarce, and artists like Tiravanija were in the nascent stages of combining Happenings, performance art, John Cage, Joseph Beuys, and the do-it-yourself ethos of punk. Meanwhile, a new art world was coming into being.", Art
"Many art-worlders have an if-you-say-so approach to art: Everyone is so scared of missing out on the next hot artist that it\'s never clear whether people are liking work because they like it or because other people do. Everyone is keeping up with the Joneses, and there are more Joneses than ever.", Art

"The artist one day falls through a hole in the brambles, and from that moment he is following the dark rapids of an underground river which may sometimes flow so near to the surface that the laughing picnic parties are heard above.", Art

"Art is the unceasing effort to compete with the beauty of flowers - and never succeeding.", Art
"Vitality is radiated from exceptional art and architecture.", Art
"The history of modern art is also the history of the progressive loss of art\'s audience. Art has increasingly become the concern of the artist and the bafflement of the public.", Art
"It is a mistake for a sculptor or a painter to speak or write very often about his job. It releases tension needed for his work.", Art
"Trying to force creativity is never good.", Art
"The writer, when he is also an artist, is someone who admits what others don\'t dare reveal.", Art
"When I think of art I think of beauty. Beauty is the mystery of life. It is not in the eye it is in the mind. In our minds there is awareness of perfection.", Art

"Banking is a very treacherous business because you don\'t realize it is risky until it is too late. It is like calm waters that deliver huge storms.", Business
"Do business managers have a commitment to anything more than the success of their company and to making money? It would be hard to say that they do. Indeed, many business leaders deny that there is any conflict between self-interest and the interests of all.", Business
"The reason is that they define how I have gone about my business. I have trusted to intuition. I did it at the beginning. I do it even now. I have no idea how things might turn out, where in my writing I might go next.", Business

"Generally the whole entertainment business now is bland.", Business
"Punctuality is the soul of business.", Business
"My husband had a very strong identity and was successful in his life. Thank God for that. There\'s no way I can control him. I wouldn\'t stay married to him if I felt I could.

"The Internet creates as well as destroys. Social networks, search advertising, and cloud computing are multibillion dollar industries that didn\'t exist 10 years ago. They are products of the same force that has rendered the Postal Service\'s core business obsolete.", Business

"My dad is like a cactus - introverted and tough. I\'m a people person, like my mom, but I got my competitiveness from my dad. He came to this country from Belarus with nothing and built a real business. He\'s my hero for giving me that need to run a business and for having enormous confidence in me.", Business
"Barack Obama\'s life was so much simpler in 2009. Back then, he had refined the cold act of blaming others for the bad economy into an art form. Deficits? Blame Bush\'s tax cuts. Spending? Blame the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. No business investment? Blame Wall Street.", Business
"Even though I\'m a hype man myself, I like the practicality of it all. People who understand how to turn a profit. At the end of the day, this is still business so I\'m looking for real practical knowledge of how to actually make money, not necessarily raise it.", Business
"I started in the restaurant business at the age of 19 as a waitress. I loved the atmosphere and the camaraderie of the restaurant business. I loved not having to go to an office. I loved making people happy.", Business
"Social media requires that business leaders start thinking like small-town shop owners. This means taking the long view and avoiding short-term benchmarks to gauge progress. It means allowing the personality, heart and soul of the people who run all levels of the business to show.", Business

"Romney is right that the Obama vision is too centered on government. But his is too centered on the promotion of business and wealth creation at the expense of everything else.", Business
"I do not want to admit to the world that I can be a bad person. It is just that I don\'t want anyone to have false expectations. Moviemaking is a harsh, volatile business, and unless you can be ruthless, too, there\'s a good chance that you are going to disappear off the scene pretty quickly.", Business
"You know, being a test pilot isn\'t always the healthiest business in the world.", Business
"I am just at that stage of wondering where I go from here. I came into this business almost by accident, but now it has become serious. What started as a bit of fun, something to do other than be a model, has taken on a different career curve. I have been forced to ask where that curve is going to end up.", Business
"I didn\'t get here for my acting... but I love show business.", Business
"I think early on I knew what I was going to do and it was based a lot on familiarity but it was also because I didn\'t have a lot of skills. There was nothing I wanted t be. I didn\'t want to be a doctor. I wanted to be in show business.", Business
"It\'s a lot of work to keep reinventing yourself and coming up with new stuff, but that\'s what it takes to be in show business.", Business
"I think that if I had grown up and had been in show business and the movies twenty five, thirty years earlier, I think I would have made a lot more musical movies.", Business
"I think the fact that I was raised in show business, in New York City, in the \'50s, that\'s affected my personality to the point that I\'m a little different.", Business
"I\'ve made movies that I thought were good. I\'ve made movies that I thought were okay, but then I was very good. And sometimes you\'re in a movie and you think, I wish more people saw that - because you\'re good. And it just works out that the movie gets lost. But that\'s show business.", Business
"Thought, not money, is the real business capital.", Business
"Dear, never forget one little point. It\'s my business. You just work here.", Business
"It\'s far too much to say that effective hoping is the only - or even the biggest - part of what it takes to succeed. If 14% of business productivity can be attributed to hope, that means 86% is dependent on raw talent, fickle business cycles, the quality of the product you\'re selling, and often pure, dumb luck.", Business

"The cars we drive say a lot about us.", Car
"I was quiet, a loner. I was one of those children where, if you put me in a room and gave me some crayons and a pencils, you wouldn\'t hear from me for nine straight hours.

"Well, I always had a chauffer, because I have never driven a car in my life. I still can\'t drive.", Car
"It\'s not just the kid who\'s spent every penny from his job to upgrade his car to tell the world he cares about sports cars, it\'s also the person driving around in a fuel-conscious hybrid electric car, because it\'s more a message to the world than an effective means of saving fuel, to be quite honest.", Car

"I liken myself to Henry Ford and the auto industry, I give you 90 percent of what most people need.", Car

"I\'m an anorak. I\'ve always been an obsessive collector of things. Richard Briers collects stamps. I collect cars and guns, which are much more expensive, and much more difficult to store.", Car
"Family trips to Yellowstone and to what are now national parks in Southern Utah, driving the primitive roads and cars of that day, were real adventures.", Car
"Parisians overwhelmingly buy small cars. And it\'s not because people are petite, but because fuel is drop-dead expensive. Gasoline costs more than twice as much in Paris as in New York.", Car

"See, what you\'re meant to do when you have a mid-life crisis is buy a fast car, aren\'t you? Well, I\'ve always had fast cars. It\'s not that. It\'s the fear that you\'re past your best. It\'s the fear that the stuff you\'ve done in the past is your best work.", Car

"When I was 19 years old, both of my parents died in the same year; my mom of cancer and my dad in a car accident. Through the next two or three years and a series of bad decisions - all my own, I might add - I ended up literally homeless, before that was even a word. I even slept occasionally under a pier on the Gulf Coast.", Car

"I compare it to being in a car accident. There\'s so much adrenaline rushing through you that you remember being in the accident but you don\'t remember any of the details.", Car
"I think it\'s particularly a distinctively American concept that resonates with American culture through biker culture. A motorcycle is an independent thing. You\'re like, \'I don\'t want to ride in a car with this person. I want to be independent and ride by myself. But, let\'s ride in a group. Let\'s be independent, together.\'", Car
"Those youngsters go out there and set a record and clinch the pole position. But what do you do if you wreck your car. That record doesn\'t spend too well.", Car
"I always thought it would be a great thing to do an art carwash. So you can actually go and get your car washed, but while you\'re sitting around waiting you can walk in that hallway where you look at the cars going through the window, and that could be changing exhibitions.", Car
"Since my induction into the Sports Hall of Fame, I have wanted to have my No. 3 Chevy on exhibit for sports fans to see. I hope others will enjoy the car as much as I have.", Car
"In the back of your mind, when you say you want to write music for the movies, you\'re saying that you want a big house, a big car and a boat. If you just wanted to write music, you could live in Kansas and do it.", Car
"I\'m not a bad driver. And I never will be because I took lessons when I was quite a boy. I never had to pass a test because there wasn\'t such a thing when I first started driving a motor car. So I didn\'t have to pass one.", Car
"I wanted to end my life so bad and was in my car ready to go down that ramp into the water, and I did go part way, but I stopped. I went again and stopped. I then got out of the car and stood by the car a nervous wreck.", Car
"I never rode in an automobile until I was 12.", Car
"I grew up with my father, so I know more about cars than most women.", Car

"Americans are the only people in the world known to me whose status anxiety prompts them to advertise their college and university affiliations in the rear window of their automobiles.", Car

"When it comes to cars, only two varieties of people are possible - cowards and fools.", Car
"Fast cars are my only vice.", Car
"Consider what kind of car you get. Buy cars and other products that have the least impact environmentally.", Car
"I\'ve always been attracted to cars, and driving is a completely measurable experience: if you qualify last on the grid, you\'re the slowest, and if you qualify first on the grid, you\'re the fastest. So no one can say you\'re slow if you\'re fast and no one can say you\'re fast if you\'re slow.", Car
"In Japan, they have TV sets in cars right now, where you can punch up traffic routes, weather, everything! You can get Internet access already in cars in Japan, so within the next 2 to 3 years it\'s gonna be so crazy!", Car

"Richard Childress and myself have made some important innovations on our cars.", Car
"People are so bad at driving cars that computers don\'t have to be that good to be much better. Any time you stand in line at the D.M.V. and look around, you\'re like, Oh, my God, I wish all these people were replaced by computer drivers.", Car
"I have a need to make these sorts of connections literal sometimes, and a vehicle often helps to do that. I have a relationship to car culture. It isn\'t really about loving cars. It\'s sort of about needing them.", Car
"I drive Fords, and I\'ve driven American cars all my life, and I want to have a strong American manufacturing sector, especially in automobiles.", Car
"In the last three years of racing I\'ve met as many women fans as men fans, and in NASCAR it\'s the same thing. My wife loves cars, but the difference is she doesn\'t have 20 years of understanding the background of them. She basically drives them and uses her gut feelings as to which is best.", Car
"The automobile engine will come, and then I will consider my life\'s work complete.", Car
"I\'ve actually made a prediction that within 30 years a majority of new cars made in the United States will be electric. And I don\'t mean hybrid, I mean fully electric.", Car

"I would never kill a living thing, although I probably have inadvertently while driving automobiles.", Car
"I love fast cars... and to go too fast in them.", Car
"I think we have to act like stars because it is expected of us. So we drive our big cars and live in our smart houses.", Car
"More books, more racing and more foolishness with cars and motorcycles are in the works.", Car
"Why did they keep changing guitars and amplifiers when they were perfect? They did the same things with cars, if you ask me. They forgot how to make them right, because they focused on style and bells and whistles.", Car

"I love everything from old-school cars to whatever the latest muscle or luxury vehicles are.", Car
"Electric cars aren\'t pollution-free; they have to get their energy from somewhere.", Car
"I love vintage cars because you can do so much more to them.", Car
"We\'re just into toys, whether it\'s motorcycles or race cars or computers. I\'ve got the Palm Pilot right here with me, I\'ve got the world\'s smallest phone. Maybe it\'s just because I\'m still a big little kid and I just love toys, you know?", Car
"I\'m starting to think about things that I want to do, things that are fun. One of them is driving a car like a Porsche. I\'ve driven a lot of cars - sedans, trucks and big family vehicles all year long. But there\'s nothing like a four-wheel-drive Porsche.", Car

I was involved in shows that people grew up with - that hold memories for them - and it\'s a cool feeling.", Cool
"I\'m a big fan of all the Boston guys that are acting - Matt Damon , Ben Affleck, Mark Wahlberg - they made a great career out of it, and they found a way to do it and still be cool guys, so that\'s kind of where I want to be.", Cool

"I\'d love to pop back into \'Being Human\' as Adam. I love the character so much. I\'ve never really played a character like that. I\'m always playing the geek, so to play a kid who is very energetic when he wants to be, and who is always trying to get the girls, was really cool.", Cool

"I liked the way my character, Shane, was first introduced. You get introduced to her through this sexual action, and I thought that was so cool and just kind of summed up what she enjoys and who she is, to a certain extent. She\'s a complete sexual being and the great thing is that she doesn\'t apologize for it. It\'s just who she is. We rarely see women be able to do that on television.", Cool

"My dad was a singer in a band and neither of my parents went to college, and I ended up getting into Harvard and was the first person in my family that went to college and it happened to be Harvard.", Dad
"The best thing I ever learned from my dad was he knew he wasn\'t the best of singers, but he always knew he was a great entertainer, and I always thought that was a good concept to bring along, that ultimately acting is an entertainment art and you have to be aware of the fact that you want people to be excited to be watching you.", Dad
"My dad\'s era believed that there was something noble in being a good guy - the kind of guy that lived straight and narrow, told the truth, and stood up for what he believed was right.", Dad
"Things with my dad were pretty good until I won an Academy Award. He was really loving to me until I got more attention than he did. Then he hated me.", Dad
"My dad liked how January went with Jones. My sisters\' names are Jina and Jacey Jones.", Dad
"We had our first earthquake over here recently. That was a bizarre feeling. I just became disoriented and I remember my dad freaking out. Nothing broke or anything.", Dad
"My dad served in the Air Force as ground crew for several years, and doesn\'t really talk about it. I know that it\'s there. I think my main thing about direct or indirect experiences as near to home as it were is the idea of self-sacrifice really.", Dad
"As it has been told to me, my Dad had some kind of deal with Dick Clark. But when we got here, that fell through. So we were out here with no job, no furniture, no food.", Dad
"When I was a kid, I wanted to walk with my dad\'s limp - my dad was my hero - but that infuriated him, and he would make me walk back and forth in the living room until I walked without it.", Dad
"My dad has always been very proud of me but I think I have exceeded his expectations. When I told him I wanted to be an actor and moved to New York City, I think he assumed I would be playing the guitar on the subway and collecting spare change in my guitar case. The fact that I\'m not doing that means that I\'m a huge success.", Dad
"My dad never told me that when you audition, you might not get the role. He wanted to wait until my first disappointment to tell me.", Dad
"My dad was my first coach and drove me extremely hard from a very young age.", Dad
"Truthfully, I\'m still Corey Hart, Dad, first.", Dad
"My dad keeps joking about sneaking into my grandparents\' house and switching out their HBO for PBS so they think I\'m on \'Downton Abbey.\'", Dad
"My dad is Greek and my mum Jamaican. My grandparents brought me up for most of my childhood, but I saw my mum and dad all the time.", Dad
"I look at my little girl and I wonder what she\'s going to be and what she\'s going to do and what is it that leads girls certain directions in life. I think a lot of that goes back to what kind of father they had, and so it makes me want to be the best dad I can possibly be.", Dad
"I had always loved music. I grew up listening to classic country, Waylon Jennings, Merle Haggard. My dad loved Vern Gosdin and Keith Whitley. So I kept going to class and started getting totally into playing guitar and teaching myself these songs.", Dad
"Dad worked his entire career as an aviation technician. Mom was a legal secretary who became a teacher. We lived a simple American life.", Dad
"It\'s always been a dream of mine to get somewhere and to have my mom and dad with me up there.", Dad

"My mum\'s parents were from Ireland, my dad\'s mum was American-Irish.", Dad
"My Dad died during the flu epidemic in 1918 when I was 4 years old. He left a lot of classical recordings behind that I began listening to at an early age, so he must have been a music lover.", Dad
"It\'s something he used to say when he was happy. It could be a very, very simple day. We might be sitting out on the front lawn. Dad loved classical music and we might be listening to some Stravinsky or something and having some tea and eggs. And he\'d say, \'Oh, good stuff, isn\'t it?\'", Dad
"Dad has, and had, a deservedly glowing reputation. However, this belief in \'reputation first\' seems to have given rise to his fears of what might be rumored after his death.", Dad
"The grief of losing my father has come in waves over the years, as it does with most people. His love and devotion as a father provided my closest, most intimate relationship. Dad, and our time together, is in my bones. While reflecting on him, the memories themselves seem to boil down into certain \'essences of Dad.\'", Dad
"When I knew I was pregnant four years ago with a boy, a friend suggested I call him Cary, but I initially resisted. There was only one Cary Grant. But a week before he was due, I started thinking it would be wonderful to pass the name on to him. And anyway, my father wasn\'t Cary to me. He was Dad.", Dad
"One of the myths about Dad was that he was mean. That simply wasn\'t true. I always found him generous to a fault but he wasn\'t reckless with his money, which was rather rare in Hollywood. He\'d grown up with nothing and he wasn\'t about to fritter it all away.", Dad
"The best word to describe my father? Thoughtful. There was a tender quality to Dad that his sense of fun could sometimes mask. But, above all, he was sensitive and looked out for those he loved.", Dad
"Can\'t blame men for wanting him. And wouldn\'t be surprised if Dad even mildly flirted back. Dad somewhat enjoyed being called gay. He said it made women want to prove the assertion wrong.", Dad
"I\'m sure there was some part of his soul was intrinsically happy, but he probably had to go through some permutations to really get that to blossom. I\'m sure Dad had his challenges, but I think that joy was there from the beginning and he had to find a way to make his life support that and express that.", Dad
"When I was a kid, I used to imagine animals running under my bed. I told my dad, and he solved the problem quickly. He cut the legs off the bed.", Dad
"Being a father to my family and a husband is to me much more important than what I did in the business.", Dad
"My dad always said, \'Don\'t worry what people think, because you can\'t change it.\'", Dad
"Rich men\'s sons are seldom rich men\'s fathers.", Dad
"No man is responsible for his father. That was entirely his mother\'s affair.", Dad
"Dad, wherever you are, you are gone but you will never be forgotten.", Dad
"Dad almost died of a heart attack in the middle of making Apocalypse Now, the biggest movie of his life. It doesn\'t make you want to jump into that business.", Dad
"What is a normal childhood? We weren\'t rich, we were pretty middle-class. My dad survived from job to job; with him taking care of so many relatives, he couldn\'t save any money.", Dad
"I was built up from my dad more than anyone else.", Dad
"My dad had a church of 90 people when I was born. It was just, over the years it continued to grow.", Dad
"I didn\'t try to copy my dad or fit into the pressure or the mold that everybody tried to make me fit into.", Dad
"Me and my dad are the biggest promoters of an estate tax in the US. It\'s not a popular position.", Dad
"When I was about 12 years old back in Houston, my Dad used to take us to the driving range.", Dad
"Don\'t forget Mother\'s Day. Or as they call it in Beverly Hills, Dad\'s Third Wife Day.", Dad
"My dad said to me growing up: \'When all is said and done, if you can count all your true friends on one hand, you\'re a lucky man.\'", Dad
"My mom and dad gave their kids the greatest gift of all - the gift of unconditional love. They cared deeply about who we would be, and much less about what we would do.", Dad
"I\'ve got high standards when it comes to boys. As my dad says, all girls should! I\'m from the South - Tennessee, to be exact - and down there, we\'re all about southern hospitality. I know that if I like a guy, he better be nice, and above all, my dad has to approve of him!", Dad
"Anyone can be a father, but it takes someone special to be a dad, and that\'s why I call you dad, because you are so special to me. You taught me the game and you taught me how to play it right.", Dad
"When it comes to Father\'s Day, I will remember my dad for both being there to nurture me and also for the times he gave me on my own to cultivate my own interests and to nurture my own spirit.", Dad
"I remember going on carriage rides with Dad when we\'d visit. I think quiet L.A. suited him better, but he loved to see shows here, he loved to visit his friends in the Hamptons.", Dad
"Simple. Pared down. Timeless. The ties were never too thick or too thin; the pants were never too flared or too skinny. In my life with Dad, he wore Western apparel because we went riding - jeans, cowboy boots, the turquoise belt buckle. But it was all very simple, and that classic look is very \'Ralph Lauren.\'", Dad
"I\'ve got an idea for a modern day faerie tale that I think would made a great short novel. But I just don\'t have the time to work on it right now. I\'m way too busy with the \'Kingkiller Chronicles\' and being a new dad.", Dad
"My mother\'s incredibly giving, almost too giving at times. And, my dad is a real logical person. He\'s got logic for every situation. They\'ve been married for 24 years, so there was that stability, also. I really learned to think on my own at a very young age.", Dad
"I love playing a dad. It\'s hard to find family dramas that are genuinely funny.", Dad
"That\'s a tough question; I\'ve been acting since I was 10. My dad was an entrepreneur, so I guess something along those lines. I wouldn\'t want a 9-5 job.", Dad
"My dad was the baby. When he was born they were already successful. They sent him to business school - he probably would have loved to have been a poet or a writer or something, and he was very creative.", Dad
"More of him came from my step-dad, who is now passed away. The initial creators of the show kind of based the character on their dads and then I added my dad.", Dad
"My dad was born in Chicago in 1908... his parents came from Russia. They settled in Chicago, where they lived in a little tiny grocery store with eight or nine children - in the backroom all together - and my grandmother got the idea to go into the movie business.", Dad
"My dad\'s an architect and my mom owned a French bakery for twelve years.", Dad
"When I realized I was having trouble reading, I was too embarrassed to ask for help. Some teachers believed in me, but I just wasn\'t focused on school - I was into the music and trying to please my dad.", Dad
"My background is basically scientific math. My Dad was a physicist, so I have it in my blood somewhere. Scientific method is very important to me. I think anything that contradicts it is probably not true.", Dad
"My father was Catholic, my mother was Protestant, and because of that I got Christened in both churches, so I\'ve got all these names... but my Dad always called me Mick.", Dad
"My mom was a dancer, my dad\'s a singer and I\'ve always had that kind of music in my life.", Dad
"My dad always said I was hard-headed, that it would take something like that to wake me up spiritually, and I guess it did. My heart had gotten so beat up that I didn\'t have anything left to give.", Dad
"It was sort of just a family sport. My mom and dad were pretty keen golfers when I was young and so were my grandparents, and I just sort of tagged along with them.", Dad
"But although Australia was also involved in the Vietnam conflict, I can remember my dad telling us that if we were in Australia, we wouldn\'t be drafted until we were 20.", Dad
"But my father was also the one who told me I needed to clean up my mouth or I\'d never find a man. What\'s very important to him is manners. Show up on time. Always send thank-you letters. He is one of the more thoughtful humans I\'ve ever met. He\'s a great man and a very good dad.", Dad
"I\'ve always had an affinity for lawyers. My dad is a lawyer. He\'s retired now. My brother is a lawyer.", Dad
"He was a manager, one of the singers, I guess talent coordinator for the local talent in Harlem. His name was Lover Patterson. He was living right across the street from where my dad had his restaurant. I guess he saw a lot of kids come in, a lot of my buddies.", Dad
"I wasn\'t sure how my dad would react. There was an agent sitting behind them and he told me he was embarrassed to watch the scenes. My parents have always been very open. They trust my decisions.", Dad
"I\'m afraid that this is me getting on my high horse now but we have yob television, yob newspapers, and funny enough whereas it was my mum and dad, school, police, church who used to set the standards, now it\'s tabloids and yob television who set the standards by which people live.", Dad
"But my mother and father were married when my mom was 20 and my dad was 24.", Dad
"I always told my dad I\'d play professional football.", Dad
"Save a boyfriend for a rainy day - and another, in case it doesn\'t rain.", Dating

"If there hadn\'t been women we\'d still be squatting in a cave eating raw meat, because we made civilization in order to impress our girlfriends.", Dating
"Real magic in relationships means an absence of judgment of others.", Dating
"Smart women love smart men more than smart men love smart women.", Dating
"It seems essential, in relationships and all tasks, that we concentrate only on what is most significant and important.", Dating
"I\'m quite sensitive to women. I saw how my sister got treated by boyfriends. I read this thing that said when you are in a relationship with a woman, imagine how you would feel if you were her father. That\'s been my approach, for the most part.", Dating
"I like the bad-boy types. Generally the guy I\'m attracted to is the guy in the club with all the tattoos and nail polish. He\'s usually the lead singer in a punk band and plays guitar. But my serious boyfriends are relatively clean-cut, nice guys. So it\'s strange.", Dating
"Personally, I don\'t like a girlfriend to have a husband. If she\'ll fool her husband, I figure she\'ll fool me.", Dating
"Nothing defines humans better than their willingness to do irrational things in the pursuit of phenomenally unlikely payoffs. This is the principle behind lotteries, dating, and religion.", Dating
"Do not just look at your boyfriend as just a boyfriend. Look at him as a friend, too.", Dating
"Right now I\'m pretty single... My career is my boyfriend.", Dating
"However successful you are, there is no substitute for a close relationship. We all need them.", Dating
"You know, the man of my dreams might walk round the corner tomorrow. I\'m older and wiser and I think I\'d make a great girlfriend. I live in the realm of romantic possibility.", Dating
"I\'m not the girl who always has a boyfriend. I\'m the girl who rarely has a boyfriend.", Dating
"You know when I feel inwardly beautiful? When I am with my girlfriends and we are having a \'goddess circle\'.", Dating
"People could rationally decide that prolonged relationships take up too much time and effort and that they\'d much rather do other kinds of things. But most people are afraid of rejection.", Dating
"I am a hopeless romantic and I love to spoil my girlfriends.", Dating
"Women are like cars: we all want a Ferrari, sometimes want a pickup truck, and end up with a station wagon.", Dating
"My boyfriend and I broke up. He wanted to get married and I didn\'t want him to.", Dating
"Well, a girlfriend once told me never to fight with anybody you don\'t love.", Dating
"If you can lie, you can act, and if you can lie to crazy girlfriends, you can act under pressure.", Dating
"I used to be a real prince charming if I went on a date with a girl. But then I\'d get to where I was likely to have a stroke from the stress of keeping up my act. I\'ve since learned the key to a good date is to pay attention on her.", Dating
"If you don\'t have a valentine, hang out with your girlfriends, don\'t go looking for someone. When it\'s right, they\'ll come to you.", Dating
"Watching your daughter being collected by her date feels like handing over a million dollar Stradivarius to a gorilla.", Dating
"I suppose I was a little bit of what would be called today a nerd. I didn\'t have girlfriends, and really I wasn\'t a very social boy.", Dating
"If you\'re a sports fan you realize that when you meet somebody, like a girlfriend, they kind of have to root for your team. They don\'t have a choice.", Dating
"Right now, I\'m as single as a slice of American cheese.", Dating
"Practically all the relationships I know are based on a foundation of lies and mutually accepted delusion.", Dating
"I don\'t know the first real thing about the dating game. I don\'t know how to talk to a specific person and connect. I just think you have to go to person by person and do the best you can with people in general.", Dating
"I\'ve never been Romeo who meets a girl and falls for her immediately. It\'s been a much slower process for me each time I\'ve gone into a relationship.", Dating
"Everything I buy is vintage and smells funny. Maybe that\'s why I don\'t have a boyfriend.", Dating
"I don\'t understand the whole dating thing. I know right off the bat if I\'m interested in someone, and I don\'t want them to waste their money on me and take me out to eat if I know I\'m not interested in that person.", Dating
"I change my mind so much I need two boyfriends and a girlfriend.", Dating
"I\'ve been dating since I was fifteen. I\'m exhausted. Where is he?", Dating
"I\'m dating a woman now who, evidently, is unaware of it.", Dating
"My boyfriend calls me \'princess\', but I think of myself more along the lines of \'monkey\' and \'retard\'.", Dating
"I\'ve had enough boyfriends and enough issues. I\'d seen enough train wrecks.", Dating
"Which is, I\'m an optimist that two people can be together to work out their conflicts. And that commitment, I think, might be what love is, because they both grow from their relationship.", Dating
"I love being a single mom. But it\'s definitely different when you\'re dating.", Dating
"I always say now that I\'m in my blonde years. Because since the end of my marriage, all of my girlfriends have been blonde.", Dating

"I don\'t know any of us who are in relationships that are totally honest - it doesn\'t exist.", Dating
"I was dating this guy and we would spend all day text messaging each other. And he thought that he could tell that he liked me more because he actually spelt the word \'YOU\' and I just put the letter \'U\'.", Dating
"Thank God I never got in a fight. All of the jock dudes hated me, but all of their girlfriends thought I was nice so they wouldn\'t touch me. It was infuriating to them.", Dating
"I didn\'t have a financial need, and I wasn\'t very gifted at relationships. I probably was more like what we think of boys as being: hard to pin down and wary of commitment.", Dating
"We are constantly protecting the male ego, and it\'s a disservice to men. If a man has any sensitivity or intelligence, he wants to get the straight scoop from his girlfriend.", Dating
"I have a lot of boyfriends, I want you to write that. Every country I visit, I have a different boyfriend. And I kiss them all.", Dating
"Things were a lot simpler in Detroit. I didn\'t care about anything but boyfriends.", Dating
"When I was first divorced, I started dating younger women, and it was really exciting. But after a while I was like, \'This is just dumb.\'", Dating
"I can\'t even explain to you how terrible that feels, that I equate dating a woman with punishment, shame, guilt, disappointment, reproach, reprimand, persecution. It\'s a nightmare.", Dating
"People say, \'Just say who you\'re dating. Then people will stop being so ravenous about it.\' It\'s like, No they won\'t! They\'ll ask for specifics.", Dating
"I\'m not very experienced with boys or the whole dating thingy.", Dating
"Well, dating has become a sport and not about finding the person you love.", Dating
"Dating is all about the chase. It\'s fun!", Dating
"I don\'t have the best dating track record.", Dating
"Dating in Los Angeles can be hard, which makes it all the better when you meet a really nice guy.", Dating

"I\'m not great at dating, but I need to do it to relax.", Dating
"I give dating advice on a regular basis. It\'s not that I\'m any expert, but it\'s always nice to share that with your friends.", Dating
"I\'m not old-fashioned when it comes to dating, but there\'s something nice about a guy pulling out a girl\'s chair and opening the door for her, even if it\'s just in the beginning.", Dating
"My mom is going to kill me for talking about sleeping with people. But I don\'t want to put myself in the position where I\'m in a monogamous relationship right now. I\'m not dating just one person. \'Sex and the City\' changed everything for me because those girls would sleep with so many people.", Dating
"All my freakouts have been pretty private and directed at family pets and/or people I have been dating for too short a time to freak out at in that way.", Dating
"I wouldn\'t tell you anything about anybody I cared about because it becomes entertainment for other people, and it sort of just cheapens everything in your life. I would never tell you if I was dating anybody.", Dating
"For a long time, I had a crazy girl dating habit.", Dating
"I\'m friends with a lot of my exes, but it took time. We didn\'t just get into it. I don\'t think you can be friends until you\'re cool with them dating someone else. That\'s when you know.", Dating
"When I started dating I had this kind of Romeo and Juliet, fateful romantic idea about love which was almost that you were a victim and there was a lot of pain involved and that was how it should be.", Dating
"I don\'t really believe in rules, but I do like old-fashioned dating where you don\'t call the guy until he calls you. I don\'t think it\'s like he\'s got to do this and that\'s the rule.", Dating
"Dating is kind of hard. Like dinner or something like that. Like a forced awkward situation is very strange. Especially for me, for some reason.", Dating
"I grew up in the world of bad television, on my dad\'s sets and then as a young schmuck on dating shows and so on.", Dating
"Coming through the fire and through the storm of life with a strong man, my fiance Ashanti, whom I\'ve been dating for eight months and two wonderful children beside me, I\'m just so happy that I have been able to maintain my integrity and get to where I am today with the right energy around me.", Dating
"I\'ve had two romances since moving to Las Vegas. One was with somebody 12 years older than me, and the other was the same age, and neither worked out. I know people still think of me as one of Hugh Hefner\'s girlfriends, and he of course was much older than me, but that was a whole different lifestyle and a different kind of dating.", Dating
"I have put gay dating on the map.", Dating
"I don\'t know why anyone would want to ask an actor for dating advice. We are not the poster children for healthy relationships.", Dating
"I feel like I am a real artist and I want to be able to feel what I am singing about. So when I sing, \'Leave (Get Out),\' I have been through that. I think it is just a new generation, whether people are ready for it or not. Teenagers are dating.", Dating

"I don\'t talk about who I\'m dating because when you break up, you wind up reliving it in the media.", Dating
"Frankly, the reason I joined MENSA is because I was dating a guy at the time who spoke five languages and could solve a Rubik\'s Cube literally with his eyes closed because it\'s just an algorithm.", Dating
"Dating now is a lot like going shopping when you don\'t have any money. Even if you find the right thing, you can\'t do anything about it.", Dating
"I\'m the one who\'s dating the craft-service guy instead of the producer. Plus, if a producer is going to date a hot young thing, I\'m probably not the first person on their list - the weird, quirky, funny girl.", Dating
"I don\'t really talk about my personal life. It\'s a strange and funny and weird thing. Sometimes you have a conversation with someone and the paparazzi snaps a picture of you and people decide you\'re dating. If I try to answer everything people say, I would be up all night.", Dating
"I\'ve been dating younger men since my 20s, When I was 29, I dated someone 21... younger men are just more fun. I like their energy. I\'ve always been kind of young for my age.", Dating
"I think a nice romantic dinner should be saved for when you and the girl you\'re dating or seeing have something special and it\'s a more special occasion.", Dating
"I grew up between the two world wars and received a rather solid general education, the kind middle class children enjoyed in a country whose educational system had its roots dating back to the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy.", Dating
"I got that experience through dating dozens of men for six years after college, getting an entry level magazine job at 21, working in the fiction department at Good Housekeeping and then working as a fashion editor there as well as writing many articles for the magazine.", Dating
"I\'m a bad dater - I\'m just not good at it. It\'s so weird dating in this town. It\'s like high school. I get a lot of people who have their publicist call my agent to ask, \'Is she dating anyone?\'", Dating
"I\'m not saying dating is sinful, and I\'m not saying a guy and a girl should never spend time alone together. I\'m saying let\'s wait until we can be purposeful, so there\'s a reason behind our relationship, and we\'re not just stirring up passion for the sake of a good time.", Dating
"I\'ve never tried to pass myself off as anything more than a comedian who wrote a dating book.", Dating

"At this year\'s Open, I\'ll have five boyfriends.", Dating
"I fantasize about going back to high school with the knowledge I have now. I would shine. I would have a good time, I would have a girlfriend. I think that\'s where a lot of my pain comes from. I think I never had any teenage years to go back to.", Dating
"I started dating older men, and I would fall in love with them. I thought they could teach me about life.", Dating
"Relationships in general make people a bit nervous. It\'s about trust. Do I trust you enough to go there?", Dating
"It was just that we had this phenomenal honeymoon relationship that just kept on going.", Dating

She had to get one of the chaperones to take her to the office and cut up her hair. I felt really bad for her, but it worked out fine.", Dating
"Appearance is something you should definitely consider when you\'re going out. Have your girlfriend clip your nails or something like that.", Dating

"The prospect of dating someone in her twenties becomes less appealing as you get older. At some point in your fife, your tolerance level goes down and you realize that, with someone much younger, there\'s nothing really to talk about.", Dating
"Workshops and seminars are basically financial speed dating for clueless people.", Dating
"I prefer ordinary girls - you know, college students, waitresses, that sort of thing. Most of the girls I go out with are just good friends. Just because I go out to the cinema with a girl, it doesn\'t mean we are dating.", Dating
"My philosophy of dating is to just fart right away.", Dating
"It\'s a big responsibility dating me. Because I come with a little bit of baggage, you know?", Dating

"Mary Tyler Moore was a working woman whose story lines were not always about dating and men. They were about work friendships and relationships, which is what I feel my adult life has mostly been about.", Dating
"After a number of years dating, we decided we were good partners.", Dating
"I ain\'t scared to do another dating show, but I ain\'t really trying to. I want to do a talk show or something. I\'ve done enough dating on television. I\'m ready to spread my wings, and go down other avenues.", Dating

"Dating is for tools.", Dating
"I have no wisdom to share on dating.", Dating
"Years later I would hear my father say the divorce had left him dating his children. That still meant picking us up every Sunday for a matinee and, if he had the money, an early dinner somewhere.", Dating
"Evolution is unobservable. It\'s based on blind faith in a few dry bones and on unreliable dating systems in which the gullible trust. Kids should be allowed to make up their own minds about this issue, and not be censored to \'one side is all we will let you hear.\'", Dating
"At the time that I knew them, they were not living together. They began dating again after their divorce, so I didn\'t really see fighting.", Dating

"Like many of you, I\'ve always been slightly obsessed with vampires, dating back to the prime-time series \'Dark Shadows,\' which I followed avidly as a kid.", Dating
"I like the idea of dating, but I\'m not dating anyone exclusively, particularly right now. It\'s hard to be in a relationship unless you\'re ready to go public with it. So it\'s a lot easier for me to not be in a relationship. I really don\'t want that part of my life to be tabloid fodder.", Dating
"Are you kidding? I\'m a terrible cook, but John is a really great one. Literally, I never cook. The whole time we were dating, I prepared two officially romantic meals. Both of them were such disasters that he begs me never to go into the kitchen again.", Dating
"So I go to my first book signing, and these two girls came up and gave me a piece of paper: \'10 reasons you should date our dad. He climbed Mount Kilimanjaro.

"Here\'s the funny thing about the response I\'ve been aware of to my dating famous people: It\'s been very negative. I\'m either not good-looking enough, not a good enough actor or not successful enough for these people.", Dating
"It\'s ironic, really. Guys should be excited that I got Kristen Bell. If Brad Pitt gets Kristen Bell, it\'s like, \'Well, of course he did.\' With me, it should be, \'Oh good, a normal-looking guy got her.

"I had to find a diet that would kick me back into dating shape, because I know that I can\'t date at size 8. I have to date at size 2. And it\'s just a fact of nature. Go get your injections and your chemical peels. You gotta look good to attract a man.", Dating
"Taylor Swift dates guys so she can write a breakup song about them. I don\'t think she\'s dating for love - I think she\'s dating for creativity. So let\'s get her off the market and put her in dating detox. If she really wants love, she has to stop writing music about them.", Dating
"The rich are different. Their wants are very high maintenance. They\'ll pick eye color and hair color, all the way down to what she does for a living, what school she went to. Their list can be extremely long. But at the end of the day, dating is dating, because they\'re human beings.", Dating

"If I\'m with a man, is that going to prevent me from achieving my goal? What sacrifices will I have to make in terms of being myself, if I\'m with a man? Something that young women find out really quickly is that when you start dating, all of a sudden you\'re supposed to have a role. You\'re not allowed to just be yourself.", Dating

"The woman I am currently crazy about was a vegetarian for a year until I started dating her. As is the case with most vegetarians, she had never eaten properly prepared meat, only commercially packaged or otherwise abused flesh.", Dating
"I heard on public radio recently, there\'s a thing called Weed Dating. Singles get together in a garden and weed and then they take turns, they keep matching up with other people. Two people will weed down one row and switch over with two other people. It\'s in Vermont. I don\'t think I\'d be very good at Weed Dating.", Dating
"I don\'t have a type. But one thing I can say from my dating experience is that a physical attraction will only take you so far. So you definitely have to have a strong intellectual connection as well.", Dating

"I\'m a fan of horrors. I love the ones that make you jump. My girlfriend hates it. I\'ve been dating her for one-and-a-half years and I\'m crazy about her, but she\'s terrified of horror films. Not the cute \'Will you hold me?\' way, but she\'s weeping. With \'House of Wax,\' we\'ll be sleeping and I\'ll go to the bathroom and she\'s sitting up waiting for me.", Dating

"I\'m enjoying dating. I\'m single, though, I\'m not in a relationship.", Dating

"Beauty is a precious trace that eternity causes to appear to us and that it takes away from us. A manifestation of eternity, and a sign of death as well.", Death
"There\'s really no such thing as the agony of dying. I\'m quite sure that pain is shut off at the moment of death. You see, something happens when the body knows it\'s about to go. Peptide hormones are released by cells in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. Endorphins. They attach themselves to the cells responsible for feeling pain.", Death
"When we are dealing with death we are constantly being dragged down by the event: Humor diverts our attention and lifts our sagging spirits.", Death
"So we mustn\'t lower our guard in any sense because of what has happened in terms of the death of Osama Bin Laden and we are certainly not doing that. The terror threat level here in the U.K. remains at severe and we\'re very conscious of the need to continue that.", Death

Wright lived into his 90s, and one of his most famous buildings, the Guggenheim Museum in New York, was completed just before his death.

"We weep over the graves of infants and the little ones taken from us by death; but an early grave may be the shortest way to heaven.", Death
"For a culture that has such a problem with death, we seem to deal with it in a quite bizarre way. We see people shot, killed and blown up, and we find it funny and sexy and all those things. But, the reality of it is that every day people die, and people are really sad and they grieve and they go through a really difficult process with it.", Death
"Death Valley is really wide-open - it\'s bigger than Rhode Island - and it\'s less a part of California than an ungoverned territory, so there\'s lots of weird cops-and-robbers stuff going on.", Death
"Our law is a Jordanian law that we inherited, which applies to both the West Bank and Gaza, and sets the death penalty for those who sell land to Israelis.", Death

"Some men give up their designs when they have almost reached the goal; While others, on the contrary, obtain a victory by exerting, at the last moment, more vigorous efforts than ever before.", Design
"Design is the method of putting form and content together. Design, just as art, has multiple definitions; there is no single definition. Design can be art. Design can be aesthetics. Design is so simple, that\'s why it is so complicated.", Design

"Design is an unknown.", Design

"If I knew for a certainty that a man was coming to my house with the conscious design of doing me good, I should run for my life.", Design
"A lot of people in our industry haven\'t had very diverse experiences. So they don\'t have enough dots to connect, and they end up with very linear solutions without a broad perspective on the problem. The broader one\'s understanding of the human experience, the better design we will have.", Design
"Design is the fundamental soul of a man-made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product or service. The iMac is not just the color or translucence or the shape of the shell. The essence of the iMac is to be the finest possible consumer computer in which each element plays together.", Design
"The design of the Mac wasn\'t what it looked like, although that was part of it. Primarily, it was how it worked. To design something really well, you have to get it. You have to really grok what it\'s all about. It takes a passionate commitment to really thoroughly understand something, chew it up, not just quickly swallow it.", Design
"In most people\'s vocabularies, design means veneer. It\'s interior decorating. It\'s the fabric of the curtains and the sofa. But to me, nothing could be further from the meaning of design.", Design
"In giving us children, God places us in a position of both leadership and service. He calls us to give up our lives for someone else\'s sake - to abandon our own desires and put our child\'s interests first. Yet, according to His perfect design, it is through this selflessness that we can become truly fulfilled.", Design
"The computer can\'t tell you the emotional story. It can give you the exact mathematical design, but what\'s missing is the eyebrows.", Design

"I always consider the settlement of America with reverence and wonder, as the opening of a grand scene and design in providence, for the illumination of the ignorant and the emancipation of the slavish part of mankind all over the earth.", Design
"I did not direct my life. I didn\'t design it. I never made decisions. Things always came up and made them for me. That\'s what life is.", Design
"Books are but waste paper unless we spend in action the wisdom we get from thought - asleep. When we are weary of the living, we may repair to the dead, who have nothing of peevishness, pride, or design in their conversation.", Design
"Graphic design is the paradise of individuality, eccentricity, heresy, abnormality, hobbies and humors.", Design
"A good scientist is a person with original ideas. A good engineer is a person who makes a design that works with as few original ideas as possible. There are no prima donnas in engineering.", Design
"Design can never be an ultimate explanation for anything. It can only be a proximate explanation. A plane or a car is explained by a designer but that\'s because the designer himself, the engineer, is explained by natural selection.", Design
"Designing is my hobby. If I didn\'t do what I do for a living - at some point when I don\'t do this for a living - I\'ll probably just do design work. I love finding really special pieces of furniture.", Design

"Art has to move you and design does not, unless it\'s a good design for a bus.", Design
"An image is not simply a trademark, a design, a slogan or an easily remembered picture. It is a studiously crafted personality profile of an individual, institution, corporation, product or service.", Design
"A purpose, an intention, a design, strikes everywhere even the careless, the most stupid thinker.", Design
"How can you look at the Texas legislature and still believe in intelligent design?", Design
"Obviously, I come from one background, and the people that design fitness equipment have been doing it for years and years, and they know what works and doesn\'t work.", Design
"I don\'t act, I don\'t direct, I don\'t design.", Design
"Good design begins with honesty, asks tough questions, comes from collaboration and from trusting your intuition.", Design
"All architecture is shelter, all great architecture is the design of space that contains, cuddles, exalts, or stimulates the persons in that space.", Design
"Design in art, is a recognition of the relation between various things, various elements in the creative flux. You can\'t invent a design. You recognize it, in the fourth dimension. That is, with your blood and your bones, as well as with your eyes.", Design
"I\'m a total control freak and love to participate in the design of every single aspect of life.", Design
"Gaming in general is a male thing. It isn\'t that gaming is designed to exclude women. Everybody who\'s tried to design a game to interest a large female audience has failed. And I think that has to do with the different thinking processes of men and women.", Design
"I really see myself continuing to design clothes, fragrances.", Design
"You all know that each title in the Chronicles has a chess theme; that\'s partly because of the overall design of the Chronicles themselves - the game of chess as an analogue of the game of life.", Design

"Architects design houses. I live in a home.", Design
"For all the drama we all have with our families and all the tension and hostility, I couldn\'t have done this without my family. Being the people that they are - they\'re crazy - made it possible for me to be crazy and to live a lifestyle of my own design.", Design
"Computers are scary. They\'re nightmares to fix, lose our stuff, and, on occasion, they crash, producing the blue screen of death. Steve Jobs knew this. He knew that computers were bulky and hernia-inducing and Darth Vader black. He understood the value of declarative design.", Design
"I would like to mention that I have flown the 262 first in May \'43. At this time, the aircraft was completely secret. I first knew of the existence of this aircraft only early in \'42 - even in my position. This aircraft didn\'t have any priority in design or production.", Design

"So much of design is context.", Design
"IBM was the original contractor for much of the computer interface design on the film.", Design
"There is not necessarily a good reason why a regulator should have to be involved in product design and marketing for rich and sophisticated investors. We recommend that such investors should be able to sign a piece of paper, which allows them to go ahead and buy unregulated products at their own risk.", Design

"I believe consistency and orthogonality are tools of design, not the primary goal in design.", Design

"We opened a design center in the South of England last year as part of our strategy for being close to our customers and developing innovative products for exciting new markets.", Design
"I don\'t design cars. I\'m not a designer. I know what I desire to be built, I know what the end result is, the horsepower, the competition we\'ll be working against - but I leave it to the people who work with me to put it all together. I don\'t do anything.", Design
"I love graphic design. I love working with design, and I love storytelling, so I\'ve been working on a children\'s book for a while, and I\'d like to see that through.", Design
"Well, yes, I mean, I think that, you know, my sources suggest that there\'s a lot of support for the notion that there is a lot of Koran abuse and that it was very much a systematic design, not just an aberration.", Design
"If a course needs to be in great condition to be played effectively, then the design strategy is flawed.", Design
"If you decide to design your own language, there are thousands of sort of amateur language designer pitfalls.", Design
"Usually I design the lighting and when I have the physical set there, I\'m not good at going out loosely and saying, \'Do you what you want, give it to the editor, and he\'ll figure it out.\' I physically then walk on with the actors and I say, \'Let\'s walk until you guys feel the space works for you, and tell me when all that happens.\'", Design

"Technology is making design more exciting, with color, wallpaper, textures, fabrics that could never have been created without the technology.", Design

"I try to look at design from a more conceptual standpoint.", Design
"Art has definitely influenced how I think of design, both as individual items and as a body of work.", Design

So I decided to move to L.A. a few years ago and it just snowballed into this thing called \'The Hunger Games.\'", Design

"I\'ve learned a lot about stage-managing for illustration. Sometimes you have to delete characters from a scene just to keep from overcrowding the image. I\'ve also learned to making big-scale design decisions early.", Design
"I wouldn\'t say design has become strictly functional. A lot of cars these days look downright comic book to me, and the info-gadgets with which late industrial people spend the most time - phones, music players, etc. - are blobjects.", Design

"I have always had an interest in fashion and design and I appreciate style and timelessness within my footwear and accessories both on and off the court.", Design
"Over the past 20 years, I have noticed that the most flexible, dynamic, inquisitive minds among my students have been industrial design majors.

"Hope is a very thin diet.", Diet
"If you think of exercise as a 60-minute commitment 3 times a week at the gym, you\'re missing the point completely. If you think that going on a diet has something to do with nutrition, you don\'t see the forest through the trees. It is a lifestyle. I know it sounds cliche, but you have to find things you love to do.", Diet
"I tried the paleo diet, which is the caveman diet - lots of meat. And I tried the calorie restriction diet: The idea is that if you eat very, very little - if you\'re on the verge of starvation, you will live a very long time, whether or not you want to, of course.", Diet

"As for my diet, I try to eat lean, clean and healthy - nothing too surprising. And I avoid too much meat or dairy because they slow you down.", Diet
"I\'m terrible with my workout regime and following it strictly. I\'m terrible with a healthy diet and following it strictly. I\'m terrible on the weekends about getting up at reasonable hours and all of those things. But, when it comes to my work and the discipline it takes to get to work on time - I hate unprofessionalism.", Diet
"Environmental concern is a little like dieting or paying off credit-card debt - an episodically terrific idea that burns brightly and then seems to fade when we realize there\'s a reason we need to diet or pay down our debt. The reason is that it\'s really, really hard, and too many of us in too many spheres of life choose the easy over the hard.", Diet

"I need protein from food rather than just protein supplements. I changed my diet.", Diet

"It\'s my firm intention to whop cancer into submission and I truly believe I\'ve given myself the best start possible by radically overhauling my diet and by staying true to my motto, which is: Don\'t worry, be happy, feel good. The first thing I did when I was diagnosed was to turn vegan.", Diet
"I did every diet: Atkins. Cabbage-soup diet. Dean Ornish. But I couldn\'t live the rest of my life like a rabbit.", Diet

"I\'ve never had body issues, I\'ve never had an eating disorder. I\'ve never had to go on a diet and that\'s because of Weight Watchers.", Diet
"I have argued for years that we do not have a health care system in America.

"I\'ve never followed a vegan or vegetarian diet in the past, but I think I could do it. It would not be easy. I have worked with nutritionists who have said a vegan diet is not necessarily all positive for your health, because you need nutrients you only find in meats. I believe in a balanced diet.", Diet

"A diet that relies heavily on meat production results in higher emissions than a typical vegetarian diet. Different individuals will make different choices. However, the debate about climate change should not be dumbed down to a single slogan, such as \'give up meat to save the planet.\'", Diet
"I know what I have to do if I want to lose weight and stay healthy: eat a proper diet and exercise. All I\'ve got to do is apply it.", Diet

"Feudal societies don\'t create great cinema; we have great theatre. The egalitarian societies create great cinema. The Americans, the French. Because equality is sort of what the cinema deals with. It deals with stories which don\'t fall into \'Everybody in their place and who\'s who,\' and all that. But the theatre\'s full of that.", Equality

"The right to a quality education is, I believe, the perfect path to bridge the gap between different cultures and to reconcile various civilizations. Without such a right, the values of liberty, justice and equality will have no meaning. Ignorance is by far the biggest danger and threat to humankind.", Equality

I didn\'t know what to do with all the fear and emotions within, and here was the Buddha saying this truth right out loud.", Experience
"To remember non-attachment is to remember what freedom is all about. If we get attached, even to a beautiful state of being, we are caught, and ultimately we will suffer. We work to observe anything that comes our way, experience it while it is here, and be able to let go of it.", Experience
"In a single moment we can understand we are not just facing a knee pain, or our discouragement and our wishing the sitting would end, but that right in the moment of seeing that knee pain, we\'re able to explore the teachings of the Buddha. What does it mean to have a painful experience? What does it mean to hate it, and to fear it?", Experience
"Doing nothing means unplugging from the compulsion to always keep ourselves busy, the habit of shielding ourselves from certain feelings, the tension of trying to manipulate our experience before we even fully acknowledge what that experience is.", Experience
"We certainly want those at the top to do well, but if you base your entire presidency and your entire economic platform on helping them do even better, you\'re missing what makes the economy tick. Because not everyone has been as fortunate as Mitt Romney, you cannot base your whole approach on a life experience as rarified as his.", Experience
"Meditation is not the construction of something foreign, it is not an effort to attain and then hold on to a particular experience. We may have a secret desire that through meditation we will accumulate a stockpile of magical experiences, or at least a mystical trophy or two, and then we will be able to proudly display them for others to see.", Experience
"There are many reasons why Mitt Romney should not become president, but perhaps the most important of all is the narrowness of his experience, perspective and vision.", Experience
"I had the closest thing I have ever had to an out-of-body experience lying in bed one morning. I turned on the \'Today\' programme and item four on the news was: \'The shadow chancellor has ruled himself out of the leadership.\' I lay there thinking that\'s interesting, then I realised it was me.", Experience
"Protection, as we use the word in Buddhism, is actually wisdom, it\'s insight. Protection is seeing and knowing deeply that all things in our experience arise due to causes, due to conditions coming together in a certain way.", Experience
"From the Buddhist point of view, it is true that emptiness is a characteristic of all of life - if we look carefully at any experience we will find transparency, insubstantiality, with no solid, unchanging core to our experience. But that does not mean that nothing matters.", Experience
"In my experience an appreciative letter from a fellow writer means a lot.", Experience
"You know, one wonderful thing that came out of my Enquirer experience is that, in my case, it was ruled tabloids are magazines. Which means they didn\'t have the protection that a newspaper has.", Experience
"A twenty-one-year-old writer is likely to be inhibited by a lack of usable experience. Childhood and adolescence were something I knew.", Experience
"The use of the term art medium is, to say the least, misleading, for it is the artist that creates a work of art not the medium. It is the artist in photography that gives form to content by a distillation of ideas, thought, experience, insight and understanding.", Experience

"When he brought it to me four years ago, Rodney King had just arrived, I was involved in the clean-up of L.A. and I guess it was part of my experience.", Experience

"We have all had the experience of finding that our reactions and perhaps even our deeds have denied beliefs we thought were ours.", Experience
"It is brilliant going to the theatre and being forced to sit and listen and think about life. It can be almost a near-religious experience.", Experience
"My kids will grow up in a house knowing that it\'s perfectly normal for two men to be in love, it\'s perfectly normal for two women to be in love. My kids will grow up knowing it\'s all about love. It doesn\'t matter who you\'re with and everyone should have that experience.", Experience
"I think women don\'t grow up with the harsh world of criticism that men grow up with, we are more sensitively treated, and when you first experience the world of film-making you have to develop a very tough skin.", Experience
"With \'Bright Star\' and with \'The Piano,\' too, I felt a kind of sadness about it being in such a different era, because of my lack of experience with the era. And one of the ways I\'d get over it is to remind myself that every film, even if it\'s contemporary, creates its own world.", Experience

"Experience is a great teacher.", Experience
"If you want to know the taste of a pear, you must change the pear by eating it yourself. If you want to know the theory and methods of revolution, you must take part in revolution. All genuine knowledge originates in direct experience.", Experience

"All experience is an arch, to build upon.", Experience
"Experiences are savings which a miser puts aside. Wisdom is an inheritance which a wastrel cannot exhaust.", Experience

"The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science.", Experience
"Security is mostly a superstition. It does not exist in nature, nor do the children of men as a whole experience it. Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure. Life is either a daring adventure, or nothing.", Experience
"Happiness cannot be traveled to, owned, earned, worn or consumed. Happiness is the spiritual experience of living every minute with love, grace, and gratitude.", Experience

"Experience teaches us that it is much easier to prevent an enemy from posting themselves than it is to dislodge them after they have got possession.", Experience
"The marvelous richness of human experience would lose something of rewarding joy if there were no limitations to overcome. The hilltop hour would not be half so wonderful if there were no dark valleys to traverse.", Experience
"Many people know so little about what is beyond their short range of experience. They look within themselves - and find nothing! Therefore they conclude that there is nothing outside themselves either.", Experience
"I think theatre is by far the most rewarding experience for an actor. You get 4 weeks to rehearse your character and then at 7:30 pm you start acting and nobody stops you, acting with your entire soul.", Experience
"I had great faith in Irish actors, that they\'d be hip to the whole theatre thing, and they are. I had no illusions of coming over here as some kind of big shot. It\'s been a learning experience for me too.", Experience

"While I was pleasantly surprised by the relatively high number of jobs created in April, the fact is that job creation during this recovery period has significantly lagged both historical experience in recovery, and the projections of the Bush Administration.", Experience
"When I was thin, I had no notion of what being fat is like. When I worked in a department store, I had sold clothes to women of most sizes, so I should have known; but perhaps you have to experience the state from the inside, to understand what fat is like.", Experience
"History offers us vicarious experience. It allows the youngest student to possess the ground equally with his elders; without a knowledge of history to give him a context for present events, he is at the mercy of every social misdiagnosis handed to him.", Experience
"I talked to members of my family, and did some personal research that didn\'t really have anything to do with the time and place I was writing about, but that gave me a feeling of the experience of being black in a time and place where it was very difficult to be black.", Experience
"I think Anna and the King is a look at Asia from the Asian perspective, reflecting the Asian experience, which is very rare.", Experience

"If I\'m going to do television, I wanted that \'North and South\' experience. I wanted something that\'s going to challenge me on a constant basis.", Experience
"I wouldn\'t go up on a stage now if you paid a thousand dollars for one minute of acting. It\'s a nasty experience. You\'re up there all by yourself. You\'re so damn exposed.", Experience
"I would vote for the man who\'s lived life, who\'s done different occupations, who\'s been out in the real world and struggled to make a living, struggled to raise a family, struggled with life as it exists. So I\'d vote for experience, honest experience.", Experience
"A lot of people fear death because they think that so overwhelming an experience has to be painful, but I\'ve seen quite a few deaths, and, with one exception, I\'ve never known anyone to undergo anything like agony. That\'s amazing when you think about it. I mean, how complicated the mechanism is that\'s being taken apart.", Experience
"My time at Shell was a most valuable experience because it taught me to look at the world in a long-term way. Shell takes a 20-year view on events and plans for different scenarios. It makes you see the world as a kind of large matrix.", Experience
"I\'ve had a fair amount of experience with snakes, and I find them to be pretty honest in terms of how you read their body language and emotions. They\'ll tell you when they\'re grumpy. They\'ll tell you when they\'re okay.", Experience

"I loved making Pure Country. It was a great learning experience for me, seeing another part of the entertainment industry.", Experience
"The course of the flight up and down was exceedingly erratic, partly due to the irregularity of the air, and partly to lack of experience in handling this machine. The control of the front rudder was difficult on account of its being balanced too near the center.", Experience
"The roles... the deep roles that I\'ve gotten to play have turned my course. They\'ve changed my life experience.", Experience
"I think most artists will experience a lot of negative people on Twitter but, thank God, I\'ve got so many followers that I\'m not able to see them that much. I\'ll see some from time to time but, for the most part, I always focus on something good.", Experience
"I\'m more interested in the meaning of funerals and the mourning that people do. It\'s not a retail experience. It\'s an existential one.", Experience
"Teaching children about entrepreneurship is much like imparting any other skill or piece of knowledge. You will provide them with ways to experience how entrepreneurship works, and you guide them toward the subjects or areas they seem to show an interest in.", Experience
"Whatever it is you want to do, take a job in that field. You will learn by experience and, slow and steady, you\'ll get it done!", Experience
"Working with and collaborating with and for Peter Jackson was an incredible experience because he is such a phenomenal filmmaker.", Experience
"I would love to be a father. I had a great father who taught me how gratifying that is. I\'m not going to deny myself that. I think I\'d be good at it. Everybody wants that experience. I definitely do.", Experience
"What our men and women in uniform are doing is providing for the Iraqi people and other surrounding nations the opportunity to see, to taste and to experience the democracy that equals freedom and ultimately justice.", Experience
"Experience, already reduced to a group of impressions, is ringed round for each one of us by that thick wall of personality through which no real voice has ever pierced on its way to us, or from us to that which we can only conjecture to be without.", Experience
"The act of writing... is the act of trying to understand why my opinion is what it is. And ultimately, I think that\'s the same experience the reader has when they pick up one of my books.", Experience
"When they call the slightest spending reductions \'painful\', we will say \'If government spending prevents pain, why are we suffering so much of it?\' And \'If you want to experience real pain, just stay on the track we are on.\'", Experience
"Working with great people makes you great; you learn a lot and it also gives you the experience and confidence to move on with your own career.", Experience
"It was a great experience for a kid, because it was a bunch of kids playing on pirate ships and water slides, so looking back on it, it was the fondest experience of my childhood.", Experience
"Films that are entertainments give simple answers but I think that\'s ultimately more cynical, as it denies the viewer room to think. If there are more answers at the end, then surely it is a richer experience.", Experience
"I am very happy since when I am in different cities I can experience and learn different cultures!", Experience
"You can use your means in a good and bad way. In German-speaking art, we had such a bad experience with the Third Reich, when stories and images were used to tell lies. After the war, literature was careful not to do the same, which is why writers began to reflect on the stories they told and to make readers part of their texts. I do the same.", Experience
"You know, I\'ve learned a lot from every person I\'ve collaborated with, from Madlib to Jean Grae and Hi-Tek, to Mos to DJ Quik, to even somebody like Jermaine Dupri. I\'ve taken something important away from every experience.", Experience
"Many children are natural fantasists, I think, perhaps because their imaginations have yet to be clobbered into submission by experience.", Experience
"The world is given to me only once, not one existing and one perceived. Subject and object are only one. The barrier between them cannot be said to have broken down as a result of recent experience in the physical sciences, for this barrier does not exist.", Experience
"I had 30-something years\' experience in modeling, which is rare.", Experience
"From my experience, politicians are much more uncomfortable being made fun of than they are being preached at and screeched at - you know, and the soapbox routine. They\'re much more uneasy knowing they\'re a target of ridicule.", Experience
"Walk to work, even if it\'s four miles. Ride a bike to work. Drive a different way. On your way there, try to find beauty. You\'d be surprised how much more of the neighborhood you can perceive and experience when you\'re looking for unique spots of beauty.", Experience
"In the United States, we spend millions of dollars on sports because it promotes teamwork, discipline, and the experience of learning to make great progress in small increments. Learning to play music does all this and more.", Experience
"I don\'t think as a creator that I could create an experience that truly feels interactive if you don\'t have something to hold in your hand, if you don\'t have something like force feedback that you can feel from the controller.", Experience
"Games have grown and developed from this limited in-the-box experience to something that\'s everywhere now. Interactive content is all around us, networked, ready. This is something I\'ve been hoping for throughout my career.", Experience
"Bringing an end to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians may help the young Arab generation to realise their aspirations. Israel is more than willing to offer our experience in building a modern economy in spite of limited resources to the whole region.", Experience
"Have you ever watched someone become American? Last week, at a national citizenship conference I organize, thirty immigrants from 17 countries swore an oath and became citizens of the United States. It was a stirring experience for the hundreds of people in the room.", Experience
"But beginners to the World Economics Forum have to understand there is no single Davos experience, and there is no single Davos community either. There are numerous tribes who interact only at a minimal level.", Experience
"Someone who has experienced trauma also has gifts to offer all of us - in their depth, their knowledge of our universal vulnerability, and their experience of the power of compassion.", Experience
"I\'ve learned through experience of playing different characters, some of whom were jerks, that when you play a character who is pretentious or obnoxious, in any way, it\'s important to knock them down a peg.", Experience
"Each time you do a film you gain a lot of experience and build a visual resume where people get to know who you are.", Experience
"That\'s one of the benefits of working on big budget films. You work with people who have a lot of experience and you get to learn a lot.", Experience
"Great art - or good art - is when you look at it, experience it and it stays in your mind. I don\'t think conceptual art and traditional art are all that different.", Experience
"The president felt that it was important to send an ordinary citizen to experience the excitement of space travel as a representative for all Americans.", Experience
"We have that illusion that we are \'deciding\' what to make a character do, in order to \'convey our message\' or something like that. But, at least in my experience, you are often more like a river-rafting guide who\'s been paid a bonus to purposely steer your clients into the roughest possible water.", Experience
"Certainly I\'ve had the experience of thinking a person was one thing, and finding out they were another.", Experience
"I think we\'re the only jokeless show on television. I mean really, we have no setups and no punch lines. It\'s not a joke show. There are funny lines and funny moments but again the comedy is born of the human experience and awkward pauses are a great part of what it is to be human.", Experience
"In life there are no problems, that is, objective and external choices; there is only the life which we do not resolve as a problem but which we live as an experience, whatever the final result may be.", Experience
"While I was trying to save money to go to the National Institute of Dramatic Art in Australia I ended up getting all of this experience which meant that by the time I had enough money in the bank to go to school I didn\'t really need to go to school anymore.", Experience
"Sol has experience, pace and physical power, which nobody else has together.", Experience
"An adolescent is somebody who is in between things. A teenager is somebody who\'s kind of permanently there. And so living with them through the various teenage hopes and sorrows and joys was curiously enough a maturing experience for me.", Experience
"I feel that between my experience and my mother\'s, breast cancer is a little bit like someone who lives next door. I know what that person looks like and what their daily habits are.", Experience
"I have been blessed in many ways, and one of those is to have been born in Africa, for me a great treasure house of stories. I have been researching it since my infancy; reading about it, talking to men and women who have spent their lives in this land, living it as I have and loving it as I do. I write almost entirely from my own experience.", Experience
"Writing \'Book 1: The Maze of Bones\' didn\'t feel much different than writing one of my other novels, but I thought it was very innovative to offer the website and trading card components as well for those readers who wanted to go more in depth with the Cahill experience.", Experience
"When I write, I\'m still imagining a kid reading it on paper. I read e-books when I travel, but in general I still prefer holding an old-fashioned book in my hands. There\'s a special, tactile experience.", Experience
"Scientific understanding is often beautiful, a profoundly aesthetic experience which gives pleasure not unlike the reading of a great poem.", Experience
"The most experience I had in the criminology field is playing a thug as an actor. That was my first paid job. The police academy at the college was paying people to reenact the calls that potential cops would get. So I got to play thugs and people who were unruly.", Experience
"If you search and search and stop searching, then ultimately you\'ll find what you need. It is the experience of living.", Experience
"Acting is a very personal process. It has to do with expressing your own personality, and discovering the character you\'re playing through your own experience - so we\'re all different.", Experience
"I\'m a culture vulture, and I just want to experience it all.", Experience
"If people choose to live their life in a way that does not confront the more troubling aspects of their experience, that\'s fine, if it works for them. But it will probably make them uncomfortable if they come up against somebody like me. So they just shouldn\'t! They shouldn\'t read my work!", Experience
"If there\'s any object in human experience that\'s a precedent for what a computer should be like, it\'s a musical instrument: a device where you can explore a huge range of possibilities through an interface that connects your mind and your body, allowing you to be emotionally authentic and expressive.", Experience
"And I thought, when I have kids, that\'s the sort of well told, silly, and fun fairy tale that I would want to take them to. But it was an amazing experience. And I think Shrek is a real classic, a fairy tale classic.", Experience
"Beliefs have the power to create and the power to destroy. Human beings have the awesome ability to take any experience of their lives and create a meaning that disempowers them or one that can literally save their lives.", Experience
"Experience keeps a dear school, but fools will learn in no other.", Experience
"Fame will go by and, so long, I\'ve had you, fame. If it goes by, I\'ve always known it was fickle. So at least it\'s something I experience, but that\'s not where I live.", Experience
"I probably hold the distinction of being one movie star who, by all laws of logic, should never have made it. At each stage of my career, I lacked the experience.", Experience
"Experience, as a desire for experience, does not come off. We must not study ourselves while having an experience.", Experience
"There are three methods to gaining wisdom. The first is reflection, which is the highest. The second is limitation, which is the easiest. The third is experience, which is the bitterest.", Experience

"I don\'t have to have faith, I have experience.", Experience
"Men are wise in proportion, not to their experience, but to their capacity for experience.", Experience
"Is there anyone so wise as to learn by the experience of others?", Experience
"Once we believe in ourselves, we can risk curiosity, wonder, spontaneous delight, or any experience that reveals the human spirit.", Experience
"What each must seek in his life never was on land or sea. It is something out of his own unique potentiality for experience, something that never has been and never could have been experienced by anyone else.", Experience
"There can be no greater error than to expect, or calculate, upon real favors from nation to nation. It is an illusion which experience must cure, which a just pride ought to discard.", Experience

"And so you touch this limit, something happens and you suddenly can go a little bit further. With your mind power, your determination, your instinct, and the experience as well, you can fly very high.", Experience
"Our DNA is as a consumer company - for that individual customer who\'s voting thumbs up or thumbs down. That\'s who we think about. And we think that our job is to take responsibility for the complete user experience. And if it\'s not up to par, it\'s our fault, plain and simply.", Experience
"I have found little that is \'good\' about human beings on the whole. In my experience most of them are trash, no matter whether they publicly subscribe to this or that ethical doctrine or to none at all. That is something that you cannot say aloud, or perhaps even think.", Experience
"Experience taught me a few things. One is to listen to your gut, no matter how good something sounds on paper. The second is that you\'re generally better off sticking with what you know. And the third is that sometimes your best investments are the ones you don\'t make.", Experience
"One of the greatest moments in anybody\'s developing experience is when he no longer tries to hide from himself but determines to get acquainted with himself as he really is.", Experience
"All growth is a leap in the dark, a spontaneous unpremeditated act without benefit of experience.", Experience

"DOS is ugly and interferes with users\' experience.", Experience
"You learn from a conglomeration of the incredible past - whatever experience gotten in any way whatsoever.", Experience
"If merely \'feeling good\' could decide, drunkenness would be the supremely valid human experience.", Experience
"I gave myself permission to feel and experience all of my emotions. In order to do that, I had to stop being afraid to feel. In order to do that, I taught myself to believe that no matter what I felt or what happened when I felt it, I would be okay.", Experience
"I wasn\'t ready for fame and all that brings to your life. It was an amazing experience, but so overwhelming, because no one can tell you beforehand when it will happen or how it will impact you. So no one can tell you how to handle it, being stopped everywhere you go because people saw you on \'Oprah.\' It took me over, and I wasn\'t ready.", Experience
"I\'m not sure where I heard it or why I believed it but when I was in my mid-twenties, a few words changed my approach to and experience of prayer. The words were these: \'Every thought you think is a prayer. Every word you speak is a prayer. Every act in which you engage is a prayer, because the Spirit of God lives in you.\' Now, how awesome is that?", Experience
"I love music, and after my first experience with movies, I can\'t wait to do more.", Experience
"Some of us are interested in directors, but really the vast majority of us are interested in actors. You experience the films through the actors, so they\'re all locked into your imagination in some kind of layer of fantasy or hatred or wherever they settle into your imagination.", Experience
"I don\'t want people to sit there and objectively watch the film. I want them to experience it as something that\'s under their skin, so you try to make the films really tactile.", Experience
"While I have never been a regular churchgoer, I\'m anything but immune to the power and the majesty of the religious experience.", Experience
"You experience the films through the actors, so they\'re all locked into your imagination in some kind of layer of fantasy or hatred or wherever they settle into your imagination.", Experience
"There have been times when I felt suicidal and I would stop my head from going in that direction of negativity because I thought there\'d be something I\'d miss that was funny in the future. If there\'s a chance I\'m going to laugh tomorrow then want to live to experience that.", Experience
"I hate these platforms that are all over the place today; they are all about grabbing attention. They are suburban! I never do a platform. Well, I did, in the 1970s, but that was a bad experience.", Experience
"People only talk about what a joyous experience it is, but there is terror: Your life, as you know it, is over. It\'s over the day that child is born. It\'s over, and something completely new starts.", Experience

"The utmost thing is the user experience, to have the most useful experience.", Experience
"It is often difficult to watch yourself onscreen, especially 60-feet high. As an actor, it is an uncomfortable experience.", Experience
"It was a very profound experience, getting in touch with that part of us, in all of us human beings, that is committed beyond yourself to the point of giving everything you have, including your life, for other people, for your fellow man.", Experience
"When you do find humor in trying times, one of the first and most important changes you experience is that you see your perplexing problems in a new way - you suddenly have a new perspective on them.", Experience
"The mind when it has an old experience will add that data into its current experience, and it keeps coming up with wrong answers.", Experience
"Being a biological mother just isn\'t part of my experience this time around. However, I am a mother who continues to give birth to ideas and ways of experiencing life that challenge the norm.", Experience
"There\'s a positive side to film and television, the sense of feeding into the theater... Your fans will follow you, hopefully, and be open-minded to see you play other things and experience other stories you want to tell.", Experience
"It\'s wonderful to be in love. And it\'s definitely wonderful to cuddle and have sex and get to experience life with somebody. But it\'s OK if you don\'t find him and you\'re 24. You can find it someday.", Experience
"Quality is a direct experience independent of and prior to intellectual abstractions.", Experience
"But in the back of my mind I\'ve always looked to the biggest-scale Hollywood movies. Because to me the most satisfying experience is of watching a movie, if it\'s done really well. And so that aspiration is always it for me, if I have the opportunity to do it.", Experience
"Throughout my career, I had the great fortune to experience firsthand as well as to witness what it means to be a CIA officer.", Experience
"Far better is it to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs, even though checkered by failure... than to rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy nor suffer much, because they live in a gray twilight that knows not victory nor defeat.", Failure
"I can accept failure, everyone fails at something. But I can\'t accept not trying.", Failure
"Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful people with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated failures. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent.", Failure
"Failures are finger posts on the road to achievement.", Failure
"Do not fear mistakes. You will know failure. Continue to reach out.", Failure
"I\'ve come to believe that all my past failure and frustration were actually laying the foundation for the understandings that have created the new level of living I now enjoy.", Failure
"Remembering that I\'ll be dead soon is the most important tool I\'ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything - all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure - these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.", Failure

"Many of life\'s failures are people who did not realize how close they were to success when they gave up.", Failure
"Don\'t be afraid to fail. Don\'t waste energy trying to cover up failure. Learn from your failures and go on to the next challenge. It\'s OK to fail. If you\'re not failing, you\'re not growing.", Failure
"Before success comes in any man\'s life, he\'s sure to meet with much temporary defeat and, perhaps some failures. When defeat overtakes a man, the easiest and the most logical thing to do is to quit. That\'s exactly what the majority of men do.", Failure
"If you learn from defeat, you haven\'t really lost.", Failure
"We have forty million reasons for failure, but not a single excuse.", Failure
"Success is the result of perfection, hard work, learning from failure, loyalty, and persistence.", Failure
"Failure is not fatal, but failure to change might be.", Failure
"One of the common failings among honorable people is a failure to appreciate how thoroughly dishonorable some other people can be, and how dangerous it is to trust them.", Failure
"You are capable of more than you know. Choose a goal that seems right for you and strive to be the best, however hard the path. Aim high. Behave honorably. Prepare to be alone at times, and to endure failure. Persist! The world needs all you can give.", Failure
"Any fact facing us is not as important as our attitude toward it, for that determines our success or failure. The way you think about a fact may defeat you before you ever do anything about it. You are overcome by the fact because you think you are.", Failure
"Remember that failure is an event, not a person.", Failure
"Failure is not a single, cataclysmic event. You don\'t fail overnight. Instead, failure is a few errors in judgement, repeated every day.", Failure
"You cannot climb the ladder of success dressed in the costume of failure.", Failure
"Case studies of failure should be made a part of the vocabulary of every engineer so that he or she can recall or recite them when something in a new design or design process is suggestive of what went wrong in the case study.", Failure
"I emphasize that virtually every engineering calculation is ultimately a failure calculation, because without a failure criterion against which to measure the calculated result, it is a meaningless number.", Failure
"I employ case studies of failure into my courses, emphasizing that they teach us much more than studies of success. It is not that success stories cannot serve as models of good design or as exemplars of creative engineering. They can do that, but they cannot teach us how close to failure they are.", Failure
"It really is impossible not to like him. His success was his failure.", Failure
"Success and failure are greatly overrated. But failure gives you a whole lot more to talk about.", Failure
"And obviously, with hindsight now, now knowing what went on in the company, it would have been absolutely appropriate back then for us to have the chief executive of the company, most senior person in the United Kingdom, come and answer for the policy they were pursuing. And we ducked that, and frankly that\'s a failure of Parliament.", Failure
"After that he turned to the question of invading England. Hitler said that during the previous year he could not afford to risk a possible failure; apart from that, he had not wished to provoke the British, as he hoped to arrange peace talks.", Failure
"Persistent people begin their success where others end in failure.", Failure
"There\'s tons of creative people in television that have one failure after another, and they just step up higher. I could never get over that. When I had a failure, there was no such thing as just getting over it.", Failure
"Failure is not fatal; victory is not success.", Failure
"There\'s only one thing that can guarantee our failure, and that\'s if we quit.", Failure
"Ignorance is the failure to discriminate between the permanent and the impermanent, the pure and the impure, bliss and suffering, the Self and the non-Self.", Failure
"It is commonly said that a teacher fails if he has not been surpassed by his students. There has been no failure on our part in this regard considering how far they have gone.", Failure
"The Soviet Union did not achieve victory over the West, so was my information inadequate to help them to victory, or did it play no particular role in their failure to achieve victory?", Failure
"For every failure, there\'s an alternative course of action. You just have to find it. When you come to a roadblock, take a detour.", Failure
"A person who doubts himself is like a man who would enlist in the ranks of his enemies and bear arms against himself. He makes his failure certain by himself being the first person to be convinced of it.", Failure

"You always pass failure on your way to success.", Failure
"My life has been nothing but a failure.", Failure
"It would be great to be able to pass on to someone all of the successes, the failures, and the knowledge that one has had. To help someone, avoid all the fire, pain and anxiety would be wonderful.", Failure
"In the business world today, failure is apparently not an option. We need to change this attitude toward failure - and celebrate the idea that only by falling on our collective business faces do we learn enough to succeed down the road.", Failure
"We may be personally defeated, but our principles never!", Failure
"Do not brood over your past mistakes and failures as this will only fill your mind with grief, regret and depression. Do not repeat them in the future.", Failure

"Success is often achieved by those who don\'t know that failure is inevitable.", Failure
"There is no failure except in no longer trying.", Failure

"To establish true self-esteem we must concentrate on our successes and forget about the failures and the negatives in our lives.", Failure
"Winning is great, sure, but if you are really going to do something in life, the secret is learning how to lose. Nobody goes undefeated all the time. If you can pick up after a crushing defeat, and go on to win again, you are going to be a champion someday.", Failure
"It is not because the truth is too difficult to see that we make mistakes... we make mistakes because the easiest and most comfortable course for us is to seek insight where it accords with our emotions - especially selfish ones.", Failure
"Go on failing. Go on. Only next time, try to fail better.", Failure
"Failure after long perseverance is much grander than never to have a striving good enough to be called a failure.", Failure
"Failure is a word unknown to me.", Failure

"My whole family is very sarcastic and constantly making jokes.", Family
"Family is the one thing that is definitely not disposable.", Family
"We need a better way to talk about eating animals, a way that doesn\'t ignore or even just shruggingly accept things like habits, cravings, family and history but rather incorporates them into the conversation. The more they are allowed in, the more able we will be to follow our best instincts.", Family
"The purpose of the Seder to my mind is to inspire conversations with your family about the human drama and hopefully transmit values to the next generation. I\'ve always felt like this could be better.", Family

"For our immediate family and relatives, Canada was a land of opportunity.", Family

"Whole communities are growing up without fathers or male role models. Bringing up a family in the best of circumstances is not easy.
