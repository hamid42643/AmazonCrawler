"In the last three years of racing I\'ve met as many women fans as men fans, and in NASCAR it\'s the same thing.

"For a long time, I had a crazy girl dating habit.", Dating
"I\'m friends with a lot of my exes, but it took time. We didn\'t just get into it. I don\'t think you can be friends until you\'re cool with them dating someone else. That\'s when you know.", Dating

"I\'ve had two romances since moving to Las Vegas. One was with somebody 12 years older than me, and the other was the same age, and neither worked out.

"The design of the Mac wasn\'t what it looked like, although that was part of it. Primarily, it was how it worked. To design something really well, you have to get it. You have to really grok what it\'s all about. It takes a passionate commitment to really thoroughly understand something, chew it up, not just quickly swallow it.", Design
"In most people\'s vocabularies, design means veneer. It\'s interior decorating. It\'s the fabric of the curtains and the sofa. But to me, nothing could be further from the meaning of design.", Design
"In giving us children, God places us in a position of both leadership and service. He calls us to give up our lives for someone else\'s sake - to abandon our own desires and put our child\'s interests first. Yet, according to His perfect design, it is through this selflessness that we can become truly fulfilled.", Design

"Graphic design is the paradise of individuality, eccentricity, heresy, abnormality, hobbies and humors.", Design
"A good scientist is a person with original ideas. A good engineer is a person who makes a design that works with as few original ideas as possible. There are no prima donnas in engineering.", Design
"Design can never be an ultimate explanation for anything. It can only be a proximate explanation. A plane or a car is explained by a designer but that\'s because the designer himself, the engineer, is explained by natural selection.", Design
"Designing is my hobby. If I didn\'t do what I do for a living - at some point when I don\'t do this for a living - I\'ll probably just do design work. I love finding really special pieces of furniture.", Design

"All architecture is shelter, all great architecture is the design of space that contains, cuddles, exalts, or stimulates the persons in that space.", Design

"I\'m a total control freak and love to participate in the design of every single aspect of life.", Design
"Gaming in general is a male thing. It isn\'t that gaming is designed to exclude women. Everybody who\'s tried to design a game to interest a large female audience has failed. And I think that has to do with the different thinking processes of men and women.", Design
"I really see myself continuing to design clothes, fragrances.", Design

"To remember non-attachment is to remember what freedom is all about. If we get attached, even to a beautiful state of being, we are caught, and ultimately we will suffer. We work to observe anything that comes our way, experience it while it is here, and be able to let go of it.", Experience
"In a single moment we can understand we are not just facing a knee pain, or our discouragement and our wishing the sitting would end, but that right in the moment of seeing that knee pain, we\'re able to explore the teachings of the Buddha.

"We certainly want those at the top to do well, but if you base your entire presidency and your entire economic platform on helping them do even better, you\'re missing what makes the economy tick.

"In my experience an appreciative letter from a fellow writer means a lot.", Experience
"You know, one wonderful thing that came out of my Enquirer experience is that, in my case, it was ruled tabloids are magazines. Which means they didn\'t have the protection that a newspaper has.", Experience
"A twenty-one-year-old writer is likely to be inhibited by a lack of usable experience. Childhood and adolescence were something I knew.", Experience
"The use of the term art medium is, to say the least, misleading, for it is the artist that creates a work of art not the medium. It is the artist in photography that gives form to content by a distillation of ideas, thought, experience, insight and understanding.", Experience

"I think women don\'t grow up with the harsh world of criticism that men grow up with, we are more sensitively treated, and when you first experience the world of film-making you have to develop a very tough skin.", Experience
"With \'Bright Star\' and with \'The Piano,\' too, I felt a kind of sadness about it being in such a different era, because of my lack of experience with the era.

"Case studies of failure should be made a part of the vocabulary of every engineer so that he or she can recall or recite them when something in a new design or design process is suggestive of what went wrong in the case study.", Failure
"I emphasize that virtually every engineering calculation is ultimately a failure calculation, because without a failure criterion against which to measure the calculated result, it is a meaningless number.", Failure
"I employ case studies of failure into my courses, emphasizing that they teach us much more than studies of success. It is not that success stories cannot serve as models of good design or as exemplars of creative engineering. They can do that, but they cannot teach us how close to failure they are.", Failure

"Gardening is not trivial. If you believe that it is, closely examine why you feel that way. You may discover that this attitude has been forced upon you by mass media and the crass culture it creates and maintains. The fact is, gardening is just the opposite - it is, or should be, a central, basic expression of human life.", Gardening
"One of the least arduous but most productive of gardening jobs, the magic of deadheading never fails to delight me.

"When I speak of natural drummers I\'m talking about guys that are playing with the talent God gave \'em.", God

"The way Hollywood portrays mothers - you\'re either all good and saint-like, or you\'re all bad. And I think the real honesty of motherhood is not given a voice in movies. I miss that as an audience member.", Movies

"Too much TV hurts movies.", Movies
"Movies always are open to being remade because times change so much, and the tempo of movies changes. I think of it like a James Bond. They can have different actors play the same role...

"Movies are not scripts - movies are films; they\'re not books, they\'re not the theatre.", Movies
"I\'ve always been an animal lover. I\'ve grown up with dogs my whole life. I think that is what helped me get the role on \'Lassie\', I was comfortable around the dog, where many of the kids were afraid or intimidated by Lassie.", Movies

"Minimalism seems closest to the sophisticated storytelling of movies. Movies have really educated contemporary audiences to be the most intelligent, sophisticated audiences in history.

"Shoot a few scenes out of focus. I want to win the foreign film award.", Movies

"The moving finger writes, and having written moves on. Nor all thy piety nor all thy wit, can cancel half a line of it.", Moving On

"I don\'t live in the past at all; I\'m always wanting to do something new. I make a point of constantly trying to forget and get things out of my mind.", Moving On
"Falling out of love is chiefly a matter of forgetting how charming someone is.", Moving On
"Getting over someone is a grieving process. You mourn the loss of the relationship, and that\'s only expedited by \'Out of sight, out of mind.\' But when you walk outside and see them on a billboard or on TV or on the cover of a magazine, it reopens the wound. It\'s a high-class problem, but it\'s real.", Moving On

"I can tell you one thing, Iran is closer to developing nuclear weapons today than it was a week ago, or a month ago or a year ago. It\'s just moving on with its efforts.", Moving On
"In the theater, it\'s about taking time in a musical segment, a pause in a musical way and then moving on.", Moving On
"I don\'t believe in regretting - one should try to move on. My mum was good at that. She was deeply in love with my father, and he died when I was nine. She remarried, and her second husband died, too. I saw the grieving process she went through. My mother had this way of moving on. It was a fine trait.", Moving On
"But you know, if you live an affluent lifestyle, there are all types of trappings that are there that you have to be cognizant of, and you\'ve got to try and communicate freely and gain understanding about and then keep moving on, because you know, sometimes lifestyles are chosen for us as opposed to us choosing them.", Moving On
"As far as friendships go, things change even without the fame. People start moving on. I have a few friends that are married and are starting to have kids and I\'m like, \'Oh my goodness gracious - that\'s so insane.\' I also have friends who are just doing their own thing, which is cool.", Moving On

"Kubrick\'s vision seemed to be that humans are doomed, whereas Clarke\'s is that humans are moving on to a better stage of evolution.", Moving On
"I like to edit my sentences as I write them. I rearrange a sentence many times before moving on to the next one. For me, that editing process feels like a form of play, like a puzzle that needs solving, and it\'s one of the most satisfying parts of writing.", Moving On
"The world is a crazy, beautiful, ugly complicated place, and it keeps moving on from crisis to strangeness to beauty to weirdness to tragedy.

"O! many a shaft, at random sent, Finds mark the archer little meant! And many a word, at random spoken, May soothe or wound a heart that\'s broken!", Moving On
"Forget the past - the future will give you plenty to worry about.", Moving On
