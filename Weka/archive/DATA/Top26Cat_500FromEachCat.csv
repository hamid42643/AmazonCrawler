"People spending more of their own money on routine health care would make the system more competitive and transparent and restore the confidence between the patients and the doctors without government rationing.", Health

"I think all Americans believe in human rights. And health is an often overlooked aspect of basic human rights. And it\'s one that\'s easily corrected.

"In order to lead a country or a company, you\'ve got to get everybody on the same page and you\'ve got to be able to have a vision of where you\'re going.

"Well, my view is that the insurance companies have done awfully well and spent a lot of money on a lot of things that don\'t have anything to do with health care.", Health
"It begins and ends with money. It\'s absurd in this day and age when we need so much money for education, health, for people, that a $100 million dollars can be spent on a film. It\'s obscene.", Health

"I am just at that stage of wondering where I go from here. I came into this business almost by accident, but now it has become serious.

"There\'s always a wine bully. The one person who did read the \'Wine Spectator,\' who tells you what to drink and why the \'97 is better than the \'98. I want to punch the wine bully in the face.

"When I am with my family, then I can just sort of switch off. It\'s kind of weird, because I go back and I go into this bedroom that I have had since I was a teenager.

"While I have felt lonely many times in my life, the oddest feeling of all was after my mother, Lucille, died. My father had already died, but I always had some attachment to our big family while she was alive. It seems strange to say now that I felt so lonely, yet I did.", Family
"There is a common theme, though, in the stories I have told, which are usually associations of characters or families that are formed outside of a family circle.", Family

"Touring is tough. You\'re almost in a haze because you don\'t really know where you are half the time: You\'re in a hotel room one moment, and the next thing you know, you\'re onstage performing for 60,000 people, then you\'re back on an airplane. It\'s very hectic and I couldn\'t do it without my family.", Family

"Like all best families, we have our share of eccentricities, of impetuous and wayward youngsters and of family disagreements.", Family
"I\'m from a nice, suburban, middle-class family, but my tattoos remind me where I\'ve been.", Family
"Even though I have a nice house, nice family, the rest of my generation is still in South Central L.A. My cousins, my brothers, my sisters, they don\'t wanna move out. They don\'t want to and they don\'t have the means to sustain it. That\'s where my heart is and that\'s what I think about all the time.", Family
"Look, I\'ve got incredible pride for my family. I\'ve absolutely fallen into that cliche of a dad who could just happily talk about my daughter endlessly.", Family
"South Central is just who I am. Even though I have a nice house, nice family, the rest of my generation is still in South Central L.A. My cousins, my brothers, my sisters, they don\'t wanna move out.", Family
"There was a great complexity to my father. He was a devoted family man. But, in the same breath, he simply was not suited to an anchored life. He should have been somebody who had a backpack, an old map, a bit of change in his pocket and that was it - roaming the world.", Family
"Choosing to be in the theatre was a way to put my roots down somewhere with other people. It was a way to choose a new family.", Family
"Dying people in pre-industrial cultures typically died in the context of an extended family, clan, or tribe.", Family

"I was always on the go, and thought I was too busy to develop something like this. I thought at the time that diabetes went along with bad habits, but I was the last one in my family to eat junk food.", Family
"I don\'t want to be reincarnated, that\'s for sure. When you\'ve had rewarding experiences in your life - a loving family, friends - you don\'t need additional reassurances that you\'re going to do something with a new cast of characters. I\'d just as soon pass.", Family
"My whole family is very sarcastic and constantly making jokes.", Family
"Family is the one thing that is definitely not disposable.", Family
"We need a better way to talk about eating animals, a way that doesn\'t ignore or even just shruggingly accept things like habits, cravings, family and history but rather incorporates them into the conversation. The more they are allowed in, the more able we will be to follow our best instincts.", Family
"The purpose of the Seder to my mind is to inspire conversations with your family about the human drama and hopefully transmit values to the next generation. I\'ve always felt like this could be better.", Family
"My family put a lot of emphasis on homework, so there weren\'t too many comic books or video games for me, when I was growing up.", Family
"I remember saying goodbye to my father the night he left to join the Navy. He didn\'t have to. He was older than other servicemen and had a family to support but he wanted to be a part of the fight against fascism, not just make movies about it. I admired this about him.", Family
"I went through a period of great rebellion within my family, when I was about 9 or 10. I was mad, I had no focus, had no real interest in anything, and so I started to do things that were just rebellious and stupid.", Family
"In my family, in the days prior to television, we liked to while away the evenings by making ourselves miserable, solely based on our ability to speak the language viciously.", Family

"We\'ll sort of get over the marriage first and then maybe look at the kids. But obviously we want a family so we\'ll have to start thinking about that.", Family
"The one thing that kept our family together was the music. The only thing that our family would share emotionally was to have our dad cry over something the kids did with music.", Family
"I love children and I get along with them great. It\'s just that I believe if you\'re going to be a parent, there has to be something inside you that says, \'I want a family.\' I don\'t feel that sense of urgency.", Family

"The extraordinary thing about India is that it\'s such a family place. It\'s full of families everywhere.", Family

"I\'m starting to judge success by the time I have for myself, the time I spend with family and friends. My priorities aren\'t amending; they\'re shifting.", Family
"We\'ll be going to the fish market and a farmer\'s market this afternoon to get what we need to make and eat dinner as a family. I\'m trying to expose my kids to going to a farmers market or the fish market and learning what that\'s all about.", Family
"Pious XII was too neutral to mention the gas chambers; decent people like my own family were turned into devils by crude Christianity.", Family
"I want to be inspiring to myself, to my kids, my family, and my friends.", Family
"I was lucky. My family is wonderful. And it\'s funny, because most of my best friends come from very large families. So it always felt as if I had lots of siblings, though in the end I had to leave them and go home. I kind of got the best of both worlds as a kid.", Family
"For our immediate family and relatives, Canada was a land of opportunity.", Family
"Because sorry to say, women run the house. They run the family. They hold things up. I mean, it\'s like you don\'t ever see your mom get sick because she handles everything. And it\'s kind of amazing I think to show people just how strong women are.", Family
"This show has been a major revitalization of my family life and personal life. It gave my family an avenue to speak to me honestly.", Family

"I\'ve always known I wanted a family.", Family
"AP promoted me to the White House beat because I knew Clinton, his family, friends, and staff better than anybody in the national press corps. Those contacts helped me break a few stories and get my career in Washington jump-started.", Family
"Syria should not belong to one family, to one coterie, or to one party. It belongs to all the people of Syria equally, in all their religious and ethnic diversity.", Family

"I come from a massive family, and the youngest is twentysomething years younger than I am, so I grew up with children.", Family

"You can be cool and at the same time respect your woman, who will hopefully become your wife, who will hopefully become the mother of your kids. America needs to get back to family values.", Family
"We have it, we\'re lucky enough that we\'ve created a show where it\'s not about... a family, or a kid, it\'s about a town.", Family
"Our family was on the lunatic fringe. My mother was always completely irrepressible. My father made crowd noises into a microphone.", Family
"Whole communities are growing up without fathers or male role models. Bringing up a family in the best of circumstances is not easy. To try to do it by placing the entire burden on women - 91% of single-parent families in Britain are headed by the mother, according to census data - is practically absurd and morally indefensible.", Family
"Make space in your life for the things that matter, for family and friends, love and generosity, fun and joy. Without this, you will burn out in mid-career and wonder where your life went.", Family
"I loved the house the way you would any new house, because it is populated by your future, the family of children who will fill it with noise or chaos and satisfying busy pleasures.", Family
"We do not always appreciate the role the Queen has played in one of the most significant changes in the past 60 years: the transformation of Britain into a multi-ethnic, multi-faith society. No one does interfaith better than the Royal family, and it starts with the Queen herself.", Family
"Combined families often get bad reviews, but the family my children got when they traded away \'the suffocating four-person\' nuclear one is one that has benefited all of them.", Family
"Jews have deep respect for the Queen and the royal family. We say a prayer for them every Sabbath in synagogue. We recite a special blessing on seeing the Queen.", Family
"The only siblings I have are half-siblings. My nuclear family would have been an extra-suffocating threesome. Instead, I have an interesting brother and sister, in-laws, and darling nephews.", Family
"I have one friend that I\'ve had since I was born, and she\'s from Coatzacoalcos. She\'s not really impressed or interested in the actor\'s life. My family isn\'t really either.", Family

"Mitt Romney comes from a family of builders.", Family
"We need to recognise that what really matters isn\'t buying more and more consumer goods, but family, friends, and knowing that we are doing something worthwhile with our lives. Helping to reduce the appalling consequences of world poverty should be part of that reassessment.", Family
"Roots is not just a saga of my family. It is the symbolic saga of a people.", Family
"When you go to the movies with your whole family, it\'s a different experience. For some reason, it\'s something that you\'re all doing together and you take away something special in that.", Family

"I grew up in a family in which political issues were often discussed, and debated intensely.", Family
"My whole damn family was nice. I don\'t think I\'ve imagined it. It\'s true. Maybe it has to do with being brought up as Christian Scientists. Half of my relatives were Readers or Practitioners in the church.", Family
"My family background was deeply Christian.", Family
"The joke in our family is that we can cry reading the phone book.", Family
"We went to church every Sunday. When I was a kid, the only time I sang was around my family.", Family

"The other night I ate at a real nice family restaurant. Every table had an argument going.", Family
"My family, frankly, they weren\'t folks who went to church every week. My mother was one of the most spiritual people I knew but she didn\'t raise me in the church, so I came to my Christian faith later in life and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead.", Family
"I can make a firm pledge, under my plan, no family making less than $250,000 a year will see any form of tax increase. Not your income tax, not your payroll tax, not your capital gains taxes, not any of your taxes.", Family

"We believed in our idea - a family park where parents and children could have fun- together.", Family
"Family is conflict and it\'s something that we all relate to.", Family
"As a single withered tree, if set aflame, causes a whole forest to burn, so does a rascal son destroy a whole family.", Family
"But let me perfectly clear, because I know you\'ll hear the same old claims that rolling back these tax breaks means a massive tax increase on the American people: if your family earns less than $250,000 a year, you will not see your taxes increased a single dime. I repeat: not one single dime.", Family

"My professional dreams were coming true while I was living a personal nightmare.", Dreams
"Barack Obama knows that to create an economy built to last, we need to focus on middle-class families. Families who stay up on Sunday nights pacing the floor, like my dad did, while their children, tucked in bed, dream big dreams. Families who aren\'t sure what Monday morning will bring, but who believe our nation\'s best days are still ahead.", Dreams
"It has never been my object to record my dreams, just the determination to realize them.", Dreams

"The surest way to prevent war is not to fear it.", War
"I refuse to accept the view that mankind is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of racism and war that the bright daybreak of peace and brotherhood can never become a reality... I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word.", War

"My point was that the war was intrinsically wrong, and as a result of our participation we haven\'t improved Australia\'s security but created a greater danger at home and abroad.", War
"Bush\'s war in Iraq has done untold damage to the United States. It has impaired our military power and undermined the morale of our armed forces. Our troops were trained to project overwhelming power. They were not trained for occupation duties.", War
"After the atomic bombs were dropped, the war ended and we went into Tokyo Bay with the rest of the fleet, the Missouri and the rest of them, while they signed the terms of surrender that ended the war.", War
"For the sake of the troops, for the love of the troops, we must not add yet another casualty to this war. We must not let truth be a casualty of this war.", War
"Detainee policy in this war is hard, it\'s complicated, but we must get it right. We would be better off as a nation if we could close Gitmo safely and start a new prison that he could use that the world would see as a better way to doing business.", War
"This war is like an actress who is getting old. It is less and less photogenic and more and more dangerous.", War
"One side-effect of the so-called war on terror has been a crisis of liberalism. This is not only a question of alarmingly illiberal legislation, but a more general problem of how the liberal state deals with its anti-liberal enemies.", War
"In a war, you must hate somebody or love somebody; you must have a position or you cannot stand what goes on.", War
"There is such a thing as legitimate warfare: war has its laws; there are things which may fairly be done, and things which may not be done.", War
"If it\'s just screaming - and I know this sounds so ridiculous - that gets old. But sometimes when there\'s literal chaos, it\'s like being in a war zone, and that\'s kind of exciting. You\'re just running through the crowd of people chasing after you and no one knows what\'s going on.", War
"I think the International Criminal Court could be a threat to American security interests, because the prosecutor of the court has enormous discretion in going after war crimes. And the way the Statute of Rome is written, responsibility for war crimes can be taken all the way up the chain of command.", War
"Money is the sinews of love, as of war.", War
"We did an album one time called White Mansions, about the civil war, but it was written by a guy from England. His looking at it from over there and it not being a part of his history made it so he could be objective.", War
"The road ahead is not easy. Iraq is currently the center of the war on terror.", War
"Every child\'s taste is different. Don\'t worry if they\'re not reading \'War and Peace\' at age 12. First, build a good foundation and a positive attitude about reading by letting them pick the stories they enjoy. Make friends with a bookseller or librarian. They are a wealth of information on finding books that kids enjoy.", War

"We know we must win the war on terror to protect innocent people and the freedoms that define our way of life.", War

"My mother lived in Holland, and during World War II was incarcerated in a Japanese camp for three years.", War
"People have the problem of denial. This is one of the things I learned in Lebanon. Everybody who left Beirut when the war started, including my parents, said, \'Oh, its temporary.\' It lasted 17 years! People tend to underestimate the gravity of these situations. That\'s how they work.", War
"War - hard apprenticeship of freedom.", War
"A devastating commentary on the war in Iraq is that we have been unable to spend money on infrastructure.", War
"There is no morality in war. Morality is the privilege of those judging from the distance. War is only death and destruction.", War
"The west has a great deal to answer for in the Middle East, from Britain\'s belated empire-building after the First World War to the US and British policy that condemns modern Iraq to the material and social squalor of a half-century ago.", War

"Criticism in a time of war is essential to the maintenance of any kind of democratic government.", War
"Dropping those atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki was a war crime.", War

"I\'d like to see a world free of strife, stress, pain, hunger, war - a cool place where everyone could live.", War
"The siesta provides a delightful detour from the working day and it also has a practical value as far as productivity is concerned. Winston Churchill had a good long siesta every day during the Second World War, and he said it was the thing that enabled him to cope with the pressure.", War
"The Berlin Wall wasn\'t the only barrier to fall after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War. Traditional barriers to the flow of money, trade, people and ideas also fell.", War
"This nation has always struggled with how it was going to deal with poor people and people of color. Every few years you will see some great change in the way that they approach this. We\'ve had the war on poverty that never really got into waging a real war on poverty.", War
"President Bush has said that he does not need approval from the UN to wage war, and I\'m thinking, well, hell, he didn\'t need the approval of the American voters to become president, either.", War
"All the culture war issues will be settled by the court.", War
"During the Cold War, we were interested because we were scared that Russia and the United States were going to go to war. We were scared that Russia was going to take over the world. Every country became a battleground.", War
"The tactic of leading people into... a war that doesn\'t make any sense by telling them they are under attack, and if they raise any objection they\'re unpatriotic, is a very old tactic. And it doesn\'t intimidate me.", War
"Eisenhower was my war hero and the President I admire and respect most.", War
"War\'s dirty little secret is that some men love it.", War

"The most successful war seldom pays for its losses.", War
"As long as war is regarded as wicked, it will always have its fascination. When it is looked upon as vulgar, it will cease to be popular.", War

"Communism has never come to power in a country that was not disrupted by war or corruption, or both.", War
"The first panacea for a mismanaged nation is inflation of the currency; the second is war. Both bring a temporary prosperity; both bring a permanent ruin. But both are the refuge of political and economic opportunists.", War
"If we are to teach real peace in this world, and if we are to carry on a real war against war, we shall have to begin with the children.", War
"It is our duty still to endeavor to avoid war; but if it shall actually take place, no matter by whom brought on, we must defend ourselves. If our house be on fire, without inquiring whether it was fired from within or without, we must try to extinguish it.", War
"I am never going to have anything more to do with politics or politicians. When this war is over I shall confine myself entirely to writing and painting.", War
"In war as in life, it is often necessary when some cherished scheme has failed, to take up the best alternative open, and if so, it is folly not to work for it with all your might.", War

"Strike against war, for without you no battles can be fought!", War
"Anyone who thinks must think of the next war as they would of suicide.", War
"Everything, everything in war is barbaric... But the worst barbarity of war is that it forces men collectively to commit acts against which individually they would revolt with their whole being.", War
"Economically considered, war and revolution are always bad business.", War
"War can really cause no economic boom, at least not directly, since an increase in wealth never does result from destruction of goods.", War
"It\'s good to focus on the universal suffering that goes on in any war. Whatever the right and wrongs of the war, there is always universal suffering.", War
"However much we may sympathize with a small nation confronted by a big and powerful neighbours, we cannot in all circumstances undertake to involve the whole British Empire in a war simply on her account.", War
"What we want to do is reform the welfare system in the way that Tony Blair talked about 13 years ago but never achieved - a system that was created for the days after the Second World War. That prize is now I think achievable.", War
"War is a perversion of sex.", War

"The belief in the possibility of a short decisive war appears to be one of the most ancient and dangerous of human illusions.", War
"I am one who believes that we are, in fact, engaged in a worldwide war against terrorism. We must have the serenity to accept the fact that war is not going to go away if we ignore it.", War
"I think that this is the first war in history that on the morrow the victors sued for peace and the vanquished called for unconditional surrender.", War
"People like to make fun of the fans who camp out but people have renaissance fairs; people do Civil War re-enactments; people do what they like. I\'m tired of hearing people rage on the fans. If you don\'t like \'Twilight,\' don\'t buy a ticket.", War
"Each one of these treaties is a step for the maintenance of peace, an additional guarantee against war. It is through such machinery that the disputes between nations will be settled and war prevented.", War
"There will always be disputes between nations which, at times, will inflame the public and threaten conflicts, but the main thing is to educate the people of the world to be ever mindful that there are better means of settling such disputes than by war.", War
"One nuclear war is going to be the last nuclear - the last war, frankly, if it really gets out of hand. And I just don\'t think we ought to be prepared to accept that sort of thing.", War
"My dear Excellency! I have not gone to war to collect cheese and eggs, but for another purpose.", War
"Even under the best of circumstances, the road back from war is difficult.", War
"It is not surprising that most Pakistanis do not support America\'s bombardment of Afghanistan. The Afghans are neighbours on the brink of starvation and devastated by war. America has shown itself to be untrustworthy, a superpower that uses its values as a scabbard for its sword.", War
"I think we need to look for any opening we can to avoid a war and we shouldn\'t pass up any opportunity for resolution.", War
"You cannot be politically correct in a war.", War
"In reality, Republicans have long been at war with clean energy. They have ridiculed investments in solar and wind power, bashed energy-efficiency standards, attacked state moves to promote renewable energy and championed laws that would enshrine taxpayer subsidies for fossil fuels while stripping them from wind and solar.", War
"Maybe more climate activists will think about the climate change not as an international problem to be resolved in an air-conditioned meeting hall, but as a guerilla war to be fought in the streets.", War

"A doctrine of class war seemed to provide a solution to the problem of poverty to people who know nothing about how wealth is created.", War
"I am an opponent of Saddam Hussein, but an opponent also, of the sanctions that have killed a million Iraqi children and an opponent of the United States\' apparent desire to plunge the Middle East into a new and devastating war.", War
"I think Chris Rock at the Oscars was a great example. I thought that was intellectually hilarious. The Gap starts a war with Banana Republic... That to me was funny.", War
"After every major conflict - World War I, World War II, Korea, Vietnam, the fall of the Soviet Union - what happened was that we ultimately hollowed out the force, largely by doing deep across-the-board cuts.", War
"I was proud of the youths who opposed the war in Vietnam because they were my babies.", War
"I took every chance I could to meet with U.S. soldiers. I talked with them and read the books they gave me about the war. I decided I needed to return to my country and join with them - active duty soldiers and Vietnam Veterans in particular - to try and end the war.", War
"War is fear cloaked in courage.", War
"Fighting a war on terrorism is like fighting against crime. We can never hope to eradicate crime, so we shouldn\'t bother fighting it.", War
"What have we achieved since the end of the Second World War? We have allowed petty, bourgeois regimes in which everything is average, mediocre.", War
"It has been, after all, 11 years, more than a decade now, of defiance of U.N. resolutions by Saddam Hussein. Every obligation that he signed onto after the Gulf War, so that he would not be a threat to peace and security, he has ignored and flaunted.", War
"There is an alternative to war. It has been with us forever.", War
"Nothing is more useless in developing a nation\'s economy than a gun, and nothing blocks the road to social development more than the financial burden of war. War is the arch enemy of national progress and the modern scourge of civilized men.", War
"No man has the right to use the great powers of the Presidency to lead the people, indirectly, into war.", War
"Up until the War of the Roses there had been continual conflict in England.", War

"I think the majority of the British people are still sanguine about the need for war.", War
"The question is: how bad do things have to get before you will do something about it? Where is your line in the sand? If you don\'t enforce the constitutional limitations on your government very soon, you are likely to find out what World War III will be like.", War
"The Sandinista government became consumed with fighting a war of survival. They were up against the biggest superpower in the world.", War
"You know, this is a war of ideology, a war of thoughts and of faith. And we need people to really stand for faith and trust, not hope and change.", War
"The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.", War

"History teaches that war begins when governments believe the price of aggression is cheap.", War
"Telling us to obey instinct is like telling us to obey \'people.\' People say different things: so do instincts. Our instincts are at war... Each instinct, if you listen to it, will claim to be gratified at the expense of the rest.", War

"The world knows that America will never start a war. This generation of Americans has had enough of war and hate... we want to build a world of peace where the weak are secure and the strong are just.", War
"The soldier above all others prays for peace, for it is the soldier who must suffer and bear the deepest wounds and scars of war.", War
"If we desire to avoid insult, we must be able to repel it; if we desire to secure peace, one of the most powerful instruments of our rising prosperity, it must be known, that we are at all times ready for War.", War

"To be prepared for war is one of the most effective means of preserving peace.", War
"You say it is the good cause that hallows even war? I say unto you: it is the good war that hallows any cause.", War

"My first wish is to see this plague of mankind, war, banished from the earth.", War
"War has always been the grand sagacity of every spirit which has grown too inward and too profound; its curative power lies even in the wounds one receives.", War
"Part of what I loved - and love - about being around older people is the tangible sense of history they embody. I\'m interested in military history, for instance, because both my grandfathers fought in World War II. I\'m interested in writing because one of those grandfathers wrote books.", War
"The fact is that America has been at her most prosperous when government and the private sector have been not at war, but in a wary, if often underplayed, alliance. History is unmistakable on this point.", War
"Here is a pretty good rule of thumb for Democratic Presidents: if it didn\'t work for Franklin D. Roosevelt, who won four terms and a World War, it probably won\'t work for you either.", War

"They have called Operation Iraqi Freedom a war of choice that isn\'t part of the real war on terror. Someone should tell that to al Qaeda.", War
"I\'m actually reading \'World War Z\' again! It\'s incredibly realistic and it\'s written as an oral history through interviews with different characters. Max Brooks wrote this book in so many different voices. There are about forty or so. It\'s incredible.

"I think that horror films have a very direct relationship to the time in which they\'re made. The films that really strike a film with the public are very often reflecting something that everyone, consciously or unconsciously feeling - atomic age, post 9-11, post Iraq war; it\'s hard to predict what people are going to be afraid of.", War
"I am still profoundly troubled by the war in Nicaragua. The United States launched a covert war against another nation in violation of international law, a war that was wrong and immoral.", War
"It\'s very important to go back and keep in mind the distinction between handling these events as criminal acts, which was the way we did before 9/11, and then looking at 9/11 and saying, \'This is not a criminal act,\' not when you destroy 16 acres of Manhattan, kill 3,000 Americans, blow a big hole in the Pentagon. That\'s an act of war.", War
"I think that NATO is itself a war criminal.", War
"From our perspective, trying to deal with this continuing campaign of terror, if you will, the war on terror that we\'re engaged in, this is a continuing enterprise. The people that were involved in some of those activities before 9/11 are still out there.", War

"Four years ago, I promised to end the war in Iraq. We did. I promised to refocus on the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11. We have.

"War is evil, but it is often the lesser evil.", War
"In war the heroes always outnumber the soldiers ten to one.", War
"We\'ve used up a lot of bullets. And we talk about stimulus. But the truth is, we\'re running a federal deficit that\'s 9 percent of GDP. That is stimulative as all get out. It\'s more stimulative than any policy we\'ve followed since World War II.", War

"Artists who seek perfection in everything are those who cannot attain it in anything.", Art

"All art is autobiographical. The pearl is the oyster\'s autobiography.", Art
"Great art picks up where nature ends.", Art
"A sad fact of life lately at the Museum of Modern Art is that when it comes to group shows of contemporary painting from the collection, the bar has been set pretty low.", Art
"The alchemy of good curating amounts to this: Sometimes, placing one work of art near another makes one plus one equal three. Two artworks arranged alchemically leave each intact, transform both, and create a third thing.", Art
"Everyone goes to the same exhibitions and the same parties, stays in the same handful of hotels, eats at the same no-star restaurants, and has almost the same opinions. I adore the art world, but this is copycat behavior in a sphere that prides itself on independent thinking.", Art
"Mission accomplished. The Museum of Modern Art\'s wide-open, tall-ceilinged, super-reinforced second floor was for all intents and purposes built to accommodate monumental installations and gigantic sculptures, should the need arise. It has arisen.", Art
"\'Summer of Love: Art of the Psychedelic Era,\' the Whitney Museum\'s 40th-anniversary trip down counterculture memory lane, provides moments of buzzy fun, but it\'ll leave you only comfortably numb. For starters, it may be the whitest, straightest, most conservative show seen in a New York museum since psychedelia was new.", Art
"I love to collect modern art.", Art
"Those who love him love that he sells the most art; they take it as a point of faith that this proves Kinkade is the best. But his fans don\'t only rely on this supply-and-demand justification. They go back to values.", Art
"The reason the art world doesn\'t respond to Kinkade is because none - not one - of his ideas about subject-matter, surface, color, composition, touch, scale, form, or skill is remotely original. They\'re all cliche and already told.", Art
"Kinkade\'s paintings are worthless schmaltz, and the lamestream media that love him are wrong. However, I\'d love to see a museum mount a small show of Kinkade\'s work. I would like the art world and the wider world to argue about him in public, out in the open.", Art
"Auction houses run a rigged game. They know exactly how many people will be bidding on a work and exactly who they are. In a gallery, works of art need only one person who wants to pay for them.", Art
"Artschwager\'s art always involves looking closely at surfaces, questions what an object is, wants to make you forget the name of the thing you\'re looking at so that it might mushroom in your mind into something that triggers unexpected infinities.", Art
"Early-twentieth-century abstraction is art\'s version of Einstein\'s Theory of Relativity. It\'s the idea that changed everything everywhere: quickly, decisively, for good.", Art
"The Metropolitan Museum of Art is unsurpassed at presenting more than 50 centuries of work. I go there constantly, seeing things over and over, better than I\'ve ever seen them before.", Art
"If the Frieze Art Fair catches on, I imagine at least two great things happening. First, we will once again have a huge art fair in town that isn\'t too annoying to go to. More importantly, Frieze may finally show New Yorkers that we can cross our own waters for visual culture. That would change everything.", Art
"Art is for anyone. It just isn\'t for everyone. Still, over the past decade, its audience has hugely grown, and that\'s irked those outside the art world, who get irritated at things like incomprehensibility or money.", Art
"I often find myself privately stewing about much British art, thinking that except for their tremendous gardens, that the English are not primarily visual artists, and are, in nearly unsurpassable ways, literary.", Art
"A metaphysical tour de force of untethered meaning and involuting interlocking contrapuntal rhythms, \'The Clock\' is more than a movie or even a work of art. It is so strange and other-ish that it becomes a stream-of-consciousness algorithm unto itself - something almost inhuman.", Art
"I don\'t know much about auctions. I sometimes go to previews and see art sardined into ugly rooms. I\'ve gawked at the gaudy prices, and gaped at well-clad crowds of happy white people conspicuously spending hundreds of millions of dollars.", Art
"I love art dealers. In some ways, they\'re my favorite people in the art world. Really. I love that they put their money where their taste is, create their own aesthetic universes, support artists, employ people, and do all of this while letting us see art for free. Many are visionaries.", Art
"When museums are built these days, architects, directors, and trustees seem most concerned about social space: places to have parties, eat dinner, wine-and-dine donors. Sure, these are important these days - museums have to bring in money - but they gobble up space and push the art itself far away from the entrance.", Art
"I see 30 to 40 gallery shows a week, and no matter what kind of mood I\'m in, no matter how bad the art is, I almost always feel better afterward. I can learn as much from bad art as from good.", Art
"Jeffrey Deitch is the Jeff Koons of art dealers. Not because he\'s the biggest, best, or the richest of his kind. But because in some ways he\'s the weirdest (which is saying a lot when you\'re talking about the wonderful, wicked, lovable, and annoying creatures known as art dealers).", Art
"Many say an art dealer running a museum is a \'conflict of interest.\' But maybe the art world has lived an artificial or unintentional lie all of these years when it comes to conflicts of interest.", Art
"Of course art world ethics are important. But museums are no purer than any other institution or business. Academics aren\'t necessarily more high-minded than gallerists.", Art
"We\'re all entitled to opinions about how art institutions should behave, and entitled to voicing those opinions through whatever means available to us. We\'re also allowed to change or modify our opinions.", Art
"The art of newspaper paragraphing is to stroke a platitude until it purrs like an epigram.", Art
"Dance is the only art of which we ourselves are the stuff of which it is made.", Art
"Nothing retains less of desire in art, in science, than this will to industry, booty, possession.", Art
"I don\'t like watching people work if they\'re making art.", Art
"The basis of art is truth, both in matter and in mode.", Art
"Art is one thing that can go on mattering once it has stopped hurting.", Art
"Of course the illusion of art is to make one believe that great literature is very close to life, but exactly the opposite is true. Life is amorphous, literature is formal.", Art
"I\'m very manipulative towards directors. My theory is that everyone on the set is directing the film, we\'re all receiving art messages from the universe on how we should do the film.", Art
"I\'m very much into the costuming of any character that I portray and it\'s one of the great things about making movies is it\'s a collaborative art form so you get all these artists who are looking specifically about for this instance your character\'s costume and what that might tell about your character.", Art
"Writing stopped being fun when I discovered the difference between good writing and bad and, even more terrifying, the difference between it and true art. And after that, the whip came down.", Art
"It\'s important to debunk the myths of Africa being this benighted continent civilized only when white people arrived. In fact, Africans had been creators of culture for thousands of years before. These were very intelligent, subtle and sophisticated people, with organized societies and great art.", Art
"It has taken me years of struggle, hard work and research to learn to make one simple gesture, and I know enough about the art of writing to realize that it would take as many years of concentrated effort to write one simple, beautiful sentence.", Art
"Intolerance respecting other people\'s religion is toleration itself in comparison with intolerance respecting other people\'s art.", Art
"I am an anarchist in politics and an impressionist in art as well as a symbolist in literature. Not that I understand what these terms mean, but I take them to be all merely synonyms of pessimist.", Art
"All good criticism should be judged the way art is. You shouldn\'t read it the way you read history or science.", Art
"Only in men\'s imagination does every truth find an effective and undeniable existence. Imagination, not invention, is the supreme master of art as of life.", Art
"I think it\'s pretentious to create art just for the sake of stroking the artists ego.", Art
"All art is exorcism. I paint dreams and visions too; the dreams and visions of my time. Painting is the effort to produce order; order in yourself. There is much chaos in me, much chaos in our time.", Art
"The art of the parenthesis is one of the greatest secrets of eloquence in Society.", Art
"Art is the human disposition of sensible or intelligible matter for an esthetic end.", Art
"The temple of art is built in words.", Art
"Poetry is emotion put into measure. The emotion must come by nature, but the measure can be acquired by art.", Art
"Film in the 20th century, it\'s the American art form, like jazz.", Art
"There are so many opportunities in life, that the loss of two or three capabilities is not necessarily debilitating. A handicap can give you the opportunity to focus more on art, writing, or music.", Art
"The art of living consists in knowing which impulses to obey and which must be made to obey.", Art
"It\'s only a few nutcases who do art for themselves, like Van Gogh.", Art
"One bites into the brass mouthpiece of his wooden cudgel, and the other blows his cheeks out on a French horn. Do you call that Art?", Art
"The only thing approaching art in a movie is the script.", Art
"The only thing they can\'t teach you at art school is art.", Art
"The Dancer believes that his art has something to say which cannot be expressed in words or in any other way than by dancing.", Art
"The art and science of asking questions is the source of all knowledge.", Art
"The web of life is a beautiful and meaningless dance. The web of life is a process with a moving goal. The web of life is a perfectly finished work of art right where I am sitting now.", Art
"I never studied art, but taught myself to draw by imitating the New Yorker cartoonists of that day, instead of doing my homework.", Art
"I think no artist can claim to have any access to the truth, or an authentic version of an event. But obviously they have slightly better means at their disposal because they have their art to energize whatever it is they\'re trying to write about. They have music.", Art
"When you are learning about a martial art, it is about respect.", Art
"There is in fact no such thing as art for art\'s sake, art that stands above classes, art that is detached from or independent of politics. Proletarian literature and art are part of the whole proletarian revolutionary cause.", Art
"The art of effective listening is essential to clear communication, and clear communication is necessary to management success.", Art
"In an era ruled by materialism and unstable geopolitics, art must be restored to the center of public education.", Art
"If only life could be a little more tender and art a little more robust.", Art
"Politics is the art of the possible.", Art
"It seems almost backwards to me that my music seems the more emotional outlet, and the art stuff seems more about ideas.", Art
"I love fashion. I love couture. I\'m going to erect a shelf in my bedroom with an art light to be the spot for the shoes of the month.", Art
"I love prints of skulls and bones and have some taxidermy - a crow and a rabbit - to remind me of home. I like art and have a big portrait of Bjork.", Art
"All art is erotic.", Art
"Film is a very young art that is still evolving. Soon, we shall reach a balance between content and technology.", Art
"I think that is what film and art and music do; they can work as a map of sorts for your feelings.", Art
"Art is the symbol of the two noblest human efforts: to construct and to refrain from destruction.", Art
"When you live under the power of terror and segregation, you can\'t ever start a work of art.", Art
"There are so many reactions to art that make sense to me - but \'ick\' means something.", Art
"Insurrection is an art, and like all arts has its own laws.", Art
"The greatest work of art about New York? The question seems nebulous. The city\'s magic and majesty are distilled in the photographs of Alfred Stieglitz and Paul Strand.", Art
"Abstract Expressionism - the first American movement to have a worldwide influence - was remarkably short-lived: It heated up after World War II and was all but done for by 1960 (although visit any art school today and you\'ll find a would-be Willem de Kooning).", Art
"My culture-deprived, aspirational mother dragged me once a month from our northern suburb - where the word art never came up - to the Art Institute of Chicago. I hated it.", Art
"I\'m noticing a new approach to art making in recent museum and gallery shows. It flickered into focus at the New Museum\'s \'Younger Than Jesus\' last year and ran through the Whitney Biennial, and I\'m seeing it blossom and bear fruit at \'Greater New York,\' MoMA P.S. 1\'s twice-a-decade extravaganza of emerging local talent.", Art
"Outside museums, in noisy public squares, people look at people. Inside museums, we leave that realm and enter what might be called the group-mind, getting quiet to look at art.", Art
"It took the Metropolitan Museum of Art nearly 50 years to wake up to Pablo Picasso. It didn\'t own one of his paintings until 1946, when Gertrude Stein bequeathed that indomitable quasi-Cubistic picture of herself - a portrait of the writer as a sumo Buddha - to the Met, principally because she disliked the Museum of Modern Art.", Art
"Appropriation is the idea that ate the art world. Go to any Chelsea gallery or international biennial and you\'ll find it. It\'s there in paintings of photographs, photographs of advertising, sculpture with ready-made objects, videos using already-existing film.", Art
"After its hothouse incubation in the seventies, appropriation breathed important new life into art. This life flowered spectacularly over the decades - even if it\'s now close to aesthetic kudzu.", Art
"The New York art world readily proves people wrong. Just when folks say that things stink and flibbertigibbet critics wish the worst on us all because we\'re not pure enough, good omens appear.", Art
"Artistic qualities that once seemed undeniable don\'t seem so now. Sometimes these fluctuations are only fickleness of taste, momentary glitches in an artist\'s work, or an artist getting ahead of his audience (it took me ten years to catch up to Albert Oehlen). Other times, however, these problems mean there\'s something wrong with the art.", Art
"Can space break? I mean the space of art galleries. Over the past 100 years, art galleries have gone from looking like Beaux Arts salons to simple storefronts to industrial lofts to the gleaming giant white cubes of Chelsea with their shiny concrete floors.", Art
"It\'s great that New York has large spaces for art. But the enormous immaculate box has become a dated, even oppressive place. Many of these spaces were designed for sprawling installations, large paintings, and the Relational Aesthetics work of the past fifteen years.", Art
"The giant white cube is now impeding rather than enhancing the rhythms of art. It preprograms a viewer\'s journey, shifts the emphasis from process to product, and lacks individuality and openness. It\'s not that art should be seen only in rutty bombed-out environments, but it should seem alive.", Art
"It\'s art that pushes against psychological and social expectations, that tries to transform decay into something generative, that is replicative in a baroque way, that isn\'t about progress, and wants to - as Walt Whitman put it - \'contain multitudes.\'", Art
"Much good art got made while money ruled; I like a lot of it, and hardship and poverty aren\'t virtues. The good news is that, since almost no one will be selling art, artists - especially emerging ones - won\'t have to think about turning out a consistent style or creating a brand. They\'ll be able to experiment as much as they want.", Art
"When money and hype recede from the art world, one thing I won\'t miss will be what curator Francesco Bonami calls the \'Eventocracy.\' All this flashy \'art-fair art\' and those highly produced space-eating spectacles and installations wow you for a minute until you move on to the next adrenaline event.", Art
"A saboteur in the house of art and a comedienne in the house of art theory, Lawler has spent three decades documenting the secret life of art. Functioning as a kind of one-woman CSI unit, she has photographed pictures and objects in collectors\' homes, in galleries, on the walls of auction houses, and off the walls, in museum storage.", Art
"Works of art often last forever, or nearly so. But exhibitions themselves, especially gallery exhibitions, are like flowers; they bloom and then they die, then exist only as memories, or pressed in magazines and books.", Art
"If only we could persuade galleries to observe a fallow period in which, for two months every other year, new and old works of art could be sold in back rooms and all main galleries would be devoted to revisiting shows gone by.", Art
"A canon is antithetical to everything the New York art world has been about for the past 40 years, during which we went from being the center of the art world to being one of many centers.", Art
"It took me twenty years to get Steven Parrino\'s work. From the time I first saw his art, in the mid-eighties, I almost always dismissed it as mannered, Romantic, formulaic, conceptualist-formalist heavy-metal boy-art abstraction.", Art
"\'Untitled\' is a time machine that can transport you to 1992, an edgy moment when the art world was crumbling, money was scarce, and artists like Tiravanija were in the nascent stages of combining Happenings, performance art, John Cage, Joseph Beuys, and the do-it-yourself ethos of punk. Meanwhile, a new art world was coming into being.", Art
"Many art-worlders have an if-you-say-so approach to art: Everyone is so scared of missing out on the next hot artist that it\'s never clear whether people are liking work because they like it or because other people do. Everyone is keeping up with the Joneses, and there are more Joneses than ever.", Art
"Art is either plagiarism or revolution.", Art
"I\'ve been called many names like perfectionist, difficult and obsessive. I think it takes obsession, takes searching for the details for any artist to be good.", Art
"Lesser artists borrow, great artists steal.", Art
"Every artist writes his own autobiography.", Art
"Drawing is like making an expressive gesture with the advantage of permanence.", Art
"A sculptor is a person who is interested in the shape of things, a poet in words, a musician by sounds.", Art
"When I work, and in my art, I hold hands with God.", Art
"Art is the stored honey of the human soul, gathered on wings of misery and travail.", Art
"The perfection of art is to conceal art.", Art
"I choose a block of marble and chop off whatever I don\'t need.", Art
"Wherever art appears, life disappears.", Art
"An artist is never ahead of his time but most people are far behind theirs.", Art
"I don\'t think there\'s any artist of any value who doesn\'t doubt what they\'re doing.", Art
"Art is a revolt against fate. All art is a revolt against man\'s fate.", Art
"My hand is the extension of the thinking process - the creative process.", Art
"My painting does not come from the easel.", Art
"Every other artist begins with a blank canvas, a piece of paper the photographer begins with the finished product.", Art
"Time extracts various values from a painter\'s work. When these values are exhausted the pictures are forgotten, and the more a picture has to give, the greater it is.", Art
"I like to pretend that my art has nothing to do with me.", Art

"I haven\'t deliberately set out to play the blonde bombshell in my movies. In fact, it\'s probably been quite the opposite.

"The basic problem with my love relationships with women is that my standards are so high - and they apply equally to both of us.

"What matters is hard work, and emotional intelligence.", Intelligence
"I feel that I, and the people under my command, tried to use all the traditional methods of recruiting agents which were also used by other intelligence services; adopting also means like pressure, money, sex - but that did not characterize my service.", Intelligence
"Collecting intelligence information is like trying to drink water out of a fire hydrant. You know, in hindsight It\'s great. The problem is there\'s a million dots at the time.", Intelligence

"Artificial Intelligence leaves no doubt that it wants its audiences to enter a realm of pure fantasy when it identifies one of the last remaining islands of civilization as New Jersey.", Intelligence
"For four years, I listened to stories of intelligence failures, and it wasn\'t due to incompetence of anyone in the system, but that the system is so arcane.", Intelligence
"It is not government\'s job to mandate responsibility on our behalf. We have the intelligence and good sense to make wise consumption choices for ourselves and our children. It is up to us to do what is best for our health and our children\'s health.", Intelligence

"I\'m fascinated by the journey that an intelligent and an ambitious woman makes in the professional world in contrast to the journey that a man of similar ambition, of similar intelligence makes. What sort of concessions does a woman have to make? Does she have to work 20 percent harder than a man?", Intelligence
"It doesn\'t matter that Bush scares the hell out of me. What matters is that he scares the hell out of a lot of very important people in Washington who can\'t speak out, in the military, in the intelligence community.", Intelligence
"Truth knows no color; it appeals to intelligence.", Intelligence
"To lack intelligence is to be in the ring blindfolded.", Intelligence
"The object of pure physics is the unfolding of the laws of the intelligible world; the object of pure mathematics that of unfolding the laws of human intelligence.", Intelligence
"Music is an art that expresses the inexpressible. It rises far above what words can mean or the intelligence define. Its domain is the imponderable and impalpable land of the unconscious.", Intelligence
"Yes; we have a specific procedure which we follow in all cases where the Agency is in contact, for the purposes of acquiring intelligence or whatever the case may be, with an individual.", Intelligence
"This also turned out to be negative, so there is no material in the Central Intelligence Agency, either in the records or in the mind of any of the individuals, that there was any contact had or even contemplated with him.", Intelligence
"I am not a member of the CIA or any other intelligence agency.", Intelligence
"Teaching man his relatively small sphere in the creation, it also encourages him by its lessons of the unity of Nature and shows him that his power of comprehension allies him with the great intelligence over-reaching all.", Intelligence
"By the way, intelligence to me isn\'t just being book-smart or having a college degree; it\'s trusting your gut instincts, being intuitive, thinking outside the box, and sometimes just realizing that things need to change and being smart enough to change it.", Intelligence
"The Bush administration also was not straightforward about the intelligence it had, releasing tenuous information that fit its goal of attacking Iraq. I feel deceived.", Intelligence
"It is not difficult for me to have this faith, for it is incontrovertible that where there is a plan there is intelligence - an orderly, unfolding universe testifies to the truth of the most majestic statement ever uttered - \'In the beginning, God.\'", Intelligence
"I believe Business Objects is on the cusp of becoming a multi-billion-dollar sales company. There is tremendous growth potential for business intelligence.", Intelligence

"We have three centers: the emotional center, the intellectual center, and the physical body center. Each one of them has its own intelligence. How much better would we be if all three were working in unison?", Intelligence
"I think Madonna has a great deal of intelligence and capability. I have a lot of respect for her. She\'s taken her career and maximized it with intelligence and creativity.", Intelligence
"Well, our position, and our chairman has talked about this extensively, is that we had a lot of intelligence prior to 9/11. We knew that two al Qaeda operatives who ultimately participated in the 9/11 disaster were in the United States. We didn\'t find them.", Intelligence
"I\'m inspired by the sheer ingenuity and intelligence possessed by my fellow band mates.", Intelligence
"The negative cost of Lewis and Clark entering the Garden of Eden is that later expeditions regardless of what they were intended to do, later expeditions did not deal with the native peoples with the intelligence with the almost kindly resolve that Lewis and Clark did.", Intelligence
"But the same intelligence compels Germany to practise the same policy.", Intelligence
"The hypothesis of surviving intelligence and personality - not only surviving but anxious and able with difficulty to communicate - is the simplest and most straightforward and the only one that fits all the facts.", Intelligence
"In other cases, when the medium becomes entranced, the demonstration of a communicator\'s separate intelligence may become stronger and the sophistication less.", Intelligence
"Job plunges into a series of demands on and accusations of God which may be and indeed are epigrams of high intelligence, but are not noticeably patient.", Intelligence
"Judy, we think that since the 11th of September, 2001, we\'ve faced a similar heightened threat level. And we\'ve been enhancing both the exchange of intelligence and security information and the assessment of that information, because that\'s the crucial element.", Intelligence
"I never threatened him and no Syrian intelligence officer has ever pointed a gun to his head.", Intelligence
"There\'s some way in which we would prefer not to see very clearly the immense gifts and intelligence of some of the people who live in our most abject conditions. Maybe there are some things at work in deciding who gets to be society\'s winners and who gets to be society\'s losers that don\'t have to do with merit.", Intelligence
"First, I have the privilege of being Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. It is not an oxymoron I assure you.", Intelligence

"There\'s this movie, \'Zero Dark Thirty\' about the hunt for Osama bin Laden. Some have complained that too many \'secrets\' were dished out by the intelligence and special operations communities to director Kathryn Bigelow, screenwriter Mark Boal and their crew, part of a broader pattern of using intelligence for political effect.", Intelligence
"When I was at the CIA I asked my civilian advisory board to tackle some tough questions. Among the toughest: In a political culture that every day demands more transparency and more public accountability from every aspect of national life, could American intelligence continue to survive and succeed? That jury is still out.", Intelligence

"Foolishness is rarely a matter of lack of intelligence or even lack of information.", Intelligence
"Intelligence recognizes what has happened. Genius recognizes what will happen.", Intelligence
"But once you are in that field, emotional intelligence emerges as a much stronger predictor of who will be most successful, because it is how we handle ourselves in our relationships that determines how well we do once we are in a given job.", Intelligence
"Sensible and responsible women do not want to vote. The relative positions to be assumed by man and woman in the working out of our civilization were assigned long ago by a higher intelligence than ours.", Intelligence
"I don\'t deny that there are problems in the intelligence world, but I would argue that in the UK we try to uphold the highest standards in the world.", Intelligence

"The White House is giving George W. Bush intelligence briefings. You know, some of these jokes just write themselves.", Intelligence
"There are a lot of obstacles in the way of our understanding animal intelligence - not the least being that we can\'t even agree whether nonhuman species are conscious. We accept that chimps and dolphins experience awareness; we like to think dogs and cats do. But what about mice and newts? What about a fly? Is anything going on there at all?", Intelligence
"The assumption is that the right kind of society is an organic being not merely analogous to an organic being, but actually a living structure with appetites and digestions, instincts and passions, intelligence and reason.", Intelligence

"I want to exude strength and intelligence.", Intelligence
"From the lowest animals of which we can affirm intelligence up to man this type of intellect is found.", Intelligence
"I think that intelligence is such a narrow branch of the tree of life - this branch of primates we call humans. No other animal, by our definition, can be considered intelligent. So intelligence can\'t be all that important for survival, because there are so many animals that don\'t have what we call intelligence, and they\'re surviving just fine.", Intelligence
"I can remember when I was National Security Adviser, the intelligence community told us... they put out an intelligence report saying that Iran would never back off from attacks on shipping in the Gulf if we use force.", Intelligence
"And I argued with that intelligence estimate and I think it is a responsibility of policymakers to use their best judgment on the basis of the intelligence they\'ve received.", Intelligence

"So that, to me, is important that audiences are treated with an amount of respect toward their intelligence. Most Hollywood films don\'t respect their intelligence.", Intelligence
"There\'s a lot of neuroscience now raising the question, \'Is all the intelligence in the human body in the brain?\', and they\'re finding out that, no, it\'s not like that. The body has intelligence itself, and we\'re much more of an organic creature in that way.", Intelligence

"If you imagine someone with 100 percent determination and 100 percent intelligence, you can discard a lot of intelligence before they stop succeeding. But if you start discarding determination, you very quickly get an ineffectual and perpetual grad student.", Intelligence

"The \'Robben Island Bible\' has arrived at the British Museum. It\'s a garish thing, its cover plastered with pink and gold Hindu images, designed to hide its contents. Within is the finest collection of words generated by human intelligence: the complete works of William Shakespeare.", Intelligence
"The 9/11 Commission strongly recommends that the National Intelligence Director be fully in control of the budget, from developing it to implementing it, to ensuring that the National Intelligence Director has the clout to make decisions.", Intelligence
"The National Intelligence Director needs the authority to do the job we are asking him to do. That means power over the intelligence budget. And to be effective, to be allowed to do his or her job, they must have authority over the budget.", Intelligence
"The intelligence investigation under the leadership of Senator Church, which I know has helped cause this investigation by you, points out that the agencies did not disclose certain facts to us and that certain plots were going on.", Intelligence
"The Queen\'s intelligence network is a hell of a lot better than anyone\'s in this palace. Bar none. She knows everything. I don\'t know how she does it. And she sees everything.", Intelligence
"I try to put all I am as a person into what I do. My intelligence, my emotion. I\'ve done that in everything.", Intelligence
"Nothing is more important to national security and the making and conduct of good policy than timely, accurate, and relevant intelligence. Nothing is more critical to accurate and relevant intelligence than independent analysis.", Intelligence
"All officers of the Intelligence Community, and especially its most senior officer, must conduct themselves in a manner that earns and retains the public trust. The American people are uncomfortable with government activities that do not take place in the open, subject to public scrutiny and review.", Intelligence
"Before 9/11 there were weak procedures, willingness, and mechanisms for communicating among agencies for foreign intelligence and the FBI with its focus on law enforcement. The domestic-vs.-foreign barrier has been solved by the reforms after 9/11 that established the DNI.", Intelligence
"I mean enormous pressure was brought to bear - Valerie Amos, Lady Amos, went round Africa with people from our intelligence services trying to press them. I had to make sure that we didn\'t promise a misuse of aid in a way that would be illegal.", Intelligence

"When a decision is made to go to war based on intelligence, it is a fateful decision. It has ramifications and impacts way beyond the current months and years.", Intelligence
"Dr. Rice\'s record on Iraq gives me great concern. In her public statements she clearly overstated and exaggerated the intelligence concerning Iraq before the war in order to support the President\'s decision to initiate military action against Iraq.", Intelligence
"When we see animals doing remarkable things, how do we know if we\'re simply seeing tricks or signs of real intelligence? Are talented animals just obeying commands, or do they have some kind of deeper understanding? One of the biggest challenges for animal researchers is to come up with tests that can distinguish between the two.", Intelligence
"It was my mother\'s idea. Her feeling was that I didn\'t have the intelligence to pick a trade myself.", Intelligence
"Emotional intelligence begins to develop in the earliest years. All the small exchanges children have with their parents, teachers, and with each other carry emotional messages.", Intelligence
"Of course it is a very simple matter to identify genes which might modify intelligence or memory and start thinking about whether you want to enhance a human, and the next generation is going to have to deal with that issue. Should we be trying to enhance humans rather than trying to educate them and so on?", Intelligence

"It is only when you watch the dense mass of thousands of ants, crowded together around the Hill, blackening the ground, that you begin to see the whole beast, and now you observe it thinking, planning, calculating. It is an intelligence, a kind of live computer, with crawling bits for its wits.", Intelligence

"Well, I think there\'s a distinction between sexing-up the intelligence and sexing-up the presentation of the intelligence.", Intelligence
"Humans have always used our intelligence and creativity to improve our existence. After all, we invented the wheel, discovered how to make fire, invented the printing press and found a vaccine for polio.", Intelligence

"When I went on to write my next book, Working With Emotional Intelligence, I wanted to make a business case that the best performers were those people strong in these skills.", Intelligence
"The ability to take pleasure in one\'s life is a skill and is a kind of intelligence. So intelligence is a hard thing to evaluate and it manifests itself in so many different ways. I do think the ability to know how to live a life and not be miserable is a sign of that.", Intelligence
"By the 2030s, the nonbiological portion of our intelligence will predominate.", Intelligence

"The question that will decide our destiny is not whether we shall expand into space. It is: shall we be one species or a million? A million species will not exhaust the ecological niches that are awaiting the arrival of intelligence.", Intelligence

"Perhaps measuring animal intelligence by comparing it to human intelligence isn\'t the best litmus test.", Intelligence
"Intelligence is the faculty of making artificial objects, especially tools to make tools.", Intelligence
"In Europe they call geeks \'smart people,\' and frankly I think we live in a culture that doesn\'t value intelligence enough; so I am very proud in saying that I am a geek.", Intelligence

"The intelligence community gets hurt through sequestration.", Intelligence
"I do not - I never believed it\'s better to kill a terrorist than to detain him. We want to detain as many terrorists as possible so we can elicit the intelligence from them in the appropriate manner so that we can disrupt follow-on terrorist attacks.", Intelligence
"The actions that we take on the counterterrorism front, again, are to take actions against individuals where we believe that the intelligence base is so strong and the nature of the threat is so grave and serious, as well as imminent, that we have no recourse except to take this action that may involve a lethal strike.", Intelligence
"I will not, nor will I ever, publicly divulge sensitive intelligence sources and methods. For when that happens, our national security is endangered and lives can be lost.", Intelligence
"As a former career intelligence professional, I have a profound appreciation for the value of intelligence. Intelligence disrupts terrorist plots and thwarts attacks. Intelligence saves lives.", Intelligence

"We will use all lawful tools at our disposal, and that includes authorities under the renewed PATRIOT Act. We firmly believe that our intelligence gathering tools must enable us to collect the information we need to protect the American people.", Intelligence

"Without consciousness and intelligence, the universe would lack meaning.", Intelligence
"I did my military service from 1989 - 92 and I was never shot at or had to fire on anybody. I was very lucky. I was more involved in intelligence and counter-intelligence.", Intelligence
"The security of the United States, which is so dependent on having accurate and timely intelligence, is not a Republican or a Democratic issue.", Intelligence
"One of the great intellectual failures of the American intelligence community, and especially the counterterrorism community, is to assume if someone hasn\'t attacked us, it\'s because he can\'t or because we\'ve defeated him.", Intelligence

"As liberty and intelligence have increased the people have more and more revolted against the theological dogmas that contradict common sense and wound the tenderest sensibilities of the soul.", Intelligence

"I am suggesting that we recognize that in network and interface research there is something as profound (and potential wild) as Artificial Intelligence.", Intelligence
