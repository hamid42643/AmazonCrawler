'A sad fact of life lately at the Museum of Modern Art is that when it comes to group shows of contemporary painting from the collection, the bar has been set pretty low.',' Art'
'The alchemy of good curating amounts to this: Sometimes, placing one work of art near another makes one plus one equal three. Two artworks arranged alchemically leave each intact, transform both, and create a third thing.',' Art'
'Everyone goes to the same exhibitions and the same parties, stays in the same handful of hotels, eats at the same no-star restaurants, and has almost the same opinions. I adore the art world, but this is copycat behavior in a sphere that prides itself on independent thinking.',' Art'

'Summer of Love: Art of the Psychedelic Era,\' the Whitney Museum\'s 40th-anniversary trip down counterculture memory lane, provides moments of buzzy fun, but it\'ll leave you only comfortably numb.

'I love to collect modern art.',' Art'
'Those who love him love that he sells the most art; they take it as a point of faith that this proves Kinkade is the best. But his fans don\'t only rely on this supply-and-demand justification. They go back to values.',' Art'
'The reason the art world doesn\'t respond to Kinkade is because none - not one - of his ideas about subject-matter, surface, color, composition, touch, scale, form, or skill is remotely original. They\'re all cliche and already told.',' Art'
'Kinkade\'s paintings are worthless schmaltz, and the lamestream media that love him are wrong. However, I\'d love to see a museum mount a small show of Kinkade\'s work. I would like the art world and the wider world to argue about him in public, out in the open.',' Art'
'Auction houses run a rigged game. They know exactly how many people will be bidding on a work and exactly who they are. In a gallery, works of art need only one person who wants to pay for them.',' Art'
'Artschwager\'s art always involves looking closely at surfaces, questions what an object is, wants to make you forget the name of the thing you\'re looking at so that it might mushroom in your mind into something that triggers unexpected infinities.',' Art'
'Early-twentieth-century abstraction is art\'s version of Einstein\'s Theory of Relativity. It\'s the idea that changed everything everywhere: quickly, decisively, for good.',' Art'
'The Metropolitan Museum of Art is unsurpassed at presenting more than 50 centuries of work. I go there constantly, seeing things over and over, better than I\'ve ever seen them before.',' Art'
'If the Frieze Art Fair catches on, I imagine at least two great things happening. First, we will once again have a huge art fair in town that isn\'t too annoying to go to. More importantly, Frieze may finally show New Yorkers that we can cross our own waters for visual culture. That would change everything.',' Art'
'Art is for anyone. It just isn\'t for everyone. Still, over the past decade, its audience has hugely grown, and that\'s irked those outside the art world, who get irritated at things like incomprehensibility or money.',' Art'
'I often find myself privately stewing about much British art, thinking that except for their tremendous gardens, that the English are not primarily visual artists, and are, in nearly unsurpassable ways, literary.',' Art'
'A metaphysical tour de force of untethered meaning and involuting interlocking contrapuntal rhythms, \'The Clock\' is more than a movie or even a work of art. It is so strange and other-ish that it becomes a stream-of-consciousness algorithm unto itself - something almost inhuman.',' Art'
'I don\'t know much about auctions. I sometimes go to previews and see art sardined into ugly rooms. I\'ve gawked at the gaudy prices, and gaped at well-clad crowds of happy white people conspicuously spending hundreds of millions of dollars.',' Art'
'I love art dealers. In some ways, they\'re my favorite people in the art world. Really. I love that they put their money where their taste is, create their own aesthetic universes, support artists, employ people, and do all of this while letting us see art for free. Many are visionaries.',' Art'
'When museums are built these days, architects, directors, and trustees seem most concerned about social space: places to have parties, eat dinner, wine-and-dine donors. Sure, these are important these days - museums have to bring in money - but they gobble up space and push the art itself far away from the entrance.',' Art'
'I see 30 to 40 gallery shows a week, and no matter what kind of mood I\'m in, no matter how bad the art is, I almost always feel better afterward. I can learn as much from bad art as from good.',' Art'
'Jeffrey Deitch is the Jeff Koons of art dealers. Not because he\'s the biggest, best, or the richest of his kind. But because in some ways he\'s the weirdest (which is saying a lot when you\'re talking about the wonderful, wicked, lovable, and annoying creatures known as art dealers).',' Art'
'Many say an art dealer running a museum is a \'conflict of interest.\' But maybe the art world has lived an artificial or unintentional lie all of these years when it comes to conflicts of interest.',' Art'
'Of course art world ethics are important. But museums are no purer than any other institution or business. Academics aren\'t necessarily more high-minded than gallerists.',' Art'
'We\'re all entitled to opinions about how art institutions should behave, and entitled to voicing those opinions through whatever means available to us. We\'re also allowed to change or modify our opinions.',' Art'
'The art of newspaper paragraphing is to stroke a platitude until it purrs like an epigram.',' Art'
'Dance is the only art of which we ourselves are the stuff of which it is made.',' Art'

'I don\'t like watching people work if they\'re making art.',' Art'
'The basis of art is truth, both in matter and in mode.',' Art'
'Art is one thing that can go on mattering once it has stopped hurting.',' Art'
'Of course the illusion of art is to make one believe that great literature is very close to life, but exactly the opposite is true. Life is amorphous, literature is formal.',' Art'
'I\'m very manipulative towards directors. My theory is that everyone on the set is directing the film, we\'re all receiving art messages from the universe on how we should do the film.',' Art'
'I\'m very much into the costuming of any character that I portray and it\'s one of the great things about making movies is it\'s a collaborative art form so you get all these artists who are looking specifically about for this instance your character\'s costume and what that might tell about your character.',' Art'
'Writing stopped being fun when I discovered the difference between good writing and bad and, even more terrifying, the difference between it and true art. And after that, the whip came down.',' Art'
'It\'s important to debunk the myths of Africa being this benighted continent civilized only when white people arrived. In fact, Africans had been creators of culture for thousands of years before. These were very intelligent, subtle and sophisticated people, with organized societies and great art.',' Art'
'It has taken me years of struggle, hard work and research to learn to make one simple gesture, and I know enough about the art of writing to realize that it would take as many years of concentrated effort to write one simple, beautiful sentence.',' Art'
'Intolerance respecting other people\'s religion is toleration itself in comparison with intolerance respecting other people\'s art.',' Art'
'I am an anarchist in politics and an impressionist in art as well as a symbolist in literature. Not that I understand what these terms mean, but I take them to be all merely synonyms of pessimist.',' Art'
'All good criticism should be judged the way art is. You shouldn\'t read it the way you read history or science.',' Art'
'Only in men\'s imagination does every truth find an effective and undeniable existence. Imagination, not invention, is the supreme master of art as of life.',' Art'
'I think it\'s pretentious to create art just for the sake of stroking the artists ego.',' Art'
'All art is exorcism. I paint dreams and visions too; the dreams and visions of my time. Painting is the effort to produce order; order in yourself. There is much chaos in me, much chaos in our time.',' Art'
'The art of the parenthesis is one of the greatest secrets of eloquence in Society.',' Art'
'Art is the human disposition of sensible or intelligible matter for an esthetic end.',' Art'
'The temple of art is built in words.',' Art'

'Film in the 20th century, it\'s the American art form, like jazz.',' Art'
'There are so many opportunities in life, that the loss of two or three capabilities is not necessarily debilitating. A handicap can give you the opportunity to focus more on art, writing, or music.',' Art'
'The art of living consists in knowing which impulses to obey and which must be made to obey.',' Art'
'It\'s only a few nutcases who do art for themselves, like Van Gogh.',' Art'

'The web of life is a beautiful and meaningless dance. The web of life is a process with a moving goal. The web of life is a perfectly finished work of art right where I am sitting now.',' Art'
'I never studied art, but taught myself to draw by imitating the New Yorker cartoonists of that day, instead of doing my homework.',' Art'
'I think no artist can claim to have any access to the truth, or an authentic version of an event. But obviously they have slightly better means at their disposal because they have their art to energize whatever it is they\'re trying to write about. They have music.',' Art'
'When you are learning about a martial art, it is about respect.',' Art'
'There is in fact no such thing as art for art\'s sake, art that stands above classes, art that is detached from or independent of politics. Proletarian literature and art are part of the whole proletarian revolutionary cause.',' Art'

'Politics is the art of the possible.',' Art'
'It seems almost backwards to me that my music seems the more emotional outlet, and the art stuff seems more about ideas.',' Art'

'There are so many reactions to art that make sense to me - but \'ick\' means something.',' Art'
'Insurrection is an art, and like all arts has its own laws.',' Art'
'The greatest work of art about New York? The question seems nebulous. The city\'s magic and majesty are distilled in the photographs of Alfred Stieglitz and Paul Strand.',' Art'
'Abstract Expressionism - the first American movement to have a worldwide influence - was remarkably short-lived: It heated up after World War II and was all but done for by 1960 (although visit any art school today and you\'ll find a would-be Willem de Kooning).',' Art'
'My culture-deprived, aspirational mother dragged me once a month from our northern suburb - where the word art never came up - to the Art Institute of Chicago. I hated it.',' Art'
'I\'m noticing a new approach to art making in recent museum and gallery shows. It flickered into focus at the New Museum\'s \'Younger Than Jesus\' last year and ran through the Whitney Biennial, and I\'m seeing it blossom and bear fruit at \'Greater New York,\' MoMA P.S. 1\'s twice-a-decade extravaganza of emerging local talent.',' Art'
'Outside museums, in noisy public squares, people look at people. Inside museums, we leave that realm and enter what might be called the group-mind, getting quiet to look at art.',' Art'
'It took the Metropolitan Museum of Art nearly 50 years to wake up to Pablo Picasso. It didn\'t own one of his paintings until 1946, when Gertrude Stein bequeathed that indomitable quasi-Cubistic picture of herself - a portrait of the writer as a sumo Buddha - to the Met, principally because she disliked the Museum of Modern Art.',' Art'
'Appropriation is the idea that ate the art world. Go to any Chelsea gallery or international biennial and you\'ll find it. It\'s there in paintings of photographs, photographs of advertising, sculpture with ready-made objects, videos using already-existing film.',' Art'
'After its hothouse incubation in the seventies, appropriation breathed important new life into art. This life flowered spectacularly over the decades - even if it\'s now close to aesthetic kudzu.',' Art'
'The New York art world readily proves people wrong. Just when folks say that things stink and flibbertigibbet critics wish the worst on us all because we\'re not pure enough, good omens appear.',' Art'
'Artistic qualities that once seemed undeniable don\'t seem so now. Sometimes these fluctuations are only fickleness of taste, momentary glitches in an artist\'s work, or an artist getting ahead of his audience (it took me ten years to catch up to Albert Oehlen). Other times, however, these problems mean there\'s something wrong with the art.',' Art'
'Can space break? I mean the space of art galleries. Over the past 100 years, art galleries have gone from looking like Beaux Arts salons to simple storefronts to industrial lofts to the gleaming giant white cubes of Chelsea with their shiny concrete floors.',' Art'
'It\'s great that New York has large spaces for art. But the enormous immaculate box has become a dated, even oppressive place. Many of these spaces were designed for sprawling installations, large paintings, and the Relational Aesthetics work of the past fifteen years.',' Art'
'The giant white cube is now impeding rather than enhancing the rhythms of art. It preprograms a viewer\'s journey, shifts the emphasis from process to product, and lacks individuality and openness. It\'s not that art should be seen only in rutty bombed-out environments, but it should seem alive.',' Art'
'It\'s art that pushes against psychological and social expectations, that tries to transform decay into something generative, that is replicative in a baroque way, that isn\'t about progress, and wants to - as Walt Whitman put it - \'contain multitudes.\'',' Art'
'Much good art got made while money ruled; I like a lot of it, and hardship and poverty aren\'t virtues. The good news is that, since almost no one will be selling art, artists - especially emerging ones - won\'t have to think about turning out a consistent style or creating a brand. They\'ll be able to experiment as much as they want.',' Art'
'When money and hype recede from the art world, one thing I won\'t miss will be what curator Francesco Bonami calls the \'Eventocracy.\' All this flashy \'art-fair art\' and those highly produced space-eating spectacles and installations wow you for a minute until you move on to the next adrenaline event.',' Art'
'A saboteur in the house of art and a comedienne in the house of art theory, Lawler has spent three decades documenting the secret life of art.
