"My father always taught by telling stories about his experiences. His lessons were about morality and art and what insects and birds and human beings had in common.

"The beauty of it is when you can just show up and hit the notes.", Beauty
"For two thousand years, the Church has guided the development of music, carefully legislating to fuse artistic talent and aesthetic beauty with the demands of the Faith.", Beauty
"Literature isn\'t a moral beauty contest. Its power arises from the authority and audacity with which the impersonation is pulled off; the belief it inspires is what counts.", Beauty
"For me, writing is an experience. It\'s an exercise in which I want to discover myself by taking my characters to the edges of human experience, to the edges of themselves and then, asking certain questions - about love, what does it mean to love? What\'s beauty? What is true beauty?", Beauty

It\'s an exercise in which I want to discover myself by taking my characters to the edges of human experience, to the edges of themselves and then, asking certain questions - about love, what does it mean to love? What\'s beauty? What is true beauty? What does it mean to be insane - crazy?", Beauty
"Throughout the centuries, man has considered himself beautiful. I rather suppose that man only believes in his own beauty out of pride; that he is not really beautiful and he suspects this himself; for why does he look on the face of his fellow-man with such scorn?", Beauty
"I read \'The Great Gatsby\' in high school and was hypnotized by the beauty of the sentences and moved by the story about the irrevocability of lost love.", Beauty

"Life deprived of beauty is not worthy of being called human.", Beauty
"People are craving this great progress in electronics, going after computers, the Internet, etc. It\'s a giant progress technologically. But they must have a balance of soul, a balance for human beauty. That means art has an important role.", Beauty

"Most sets of values would give rise to universes that, although they might be very beautiful, would contain no one able to wonder at that beauty.", Beauty
"Everyone has their own insecurities, regardless of how you look or how people perceive you, but sometimes people give their insecurities too much power. Defining beauty is simply a matter of opinion. For me, real beauty has very little to do with the structure of someone\'s face or body.", Beauty

"I live by the philosophy that beauty starts from within, and I make a conscious effort to fill my body with nutrients through the food I eat.", Beauty
"The real beauty of it - key to my life was playing key chords on a banjo. For somebody else it may be a golf club that mom and dad put in their hands or a baseball or ballet lessons. Real gift to give to me and put it in writing.", Beauty
"Find beauty not only in the thing itself but in the pattern of the shadows, the light and dark which that thing provides.", Beauty

"It is curious how, from time immemorial, man seems to have associated the idea of evil with beauty, shrunk from it with a sort of ghostly fear, while, at the same time drawn to it by force of its hypnotic attraction.", Beauty
"We also maintain - again with perfect truth - that mystery is more than half of beauty, the element of strangeness that stirs the senses through the imagination.", Beauty

"Beauty can make you powerful in a way that isn\'t good for you. Being OK is better for the person I have become.", Beauty
"I look OK. I look better in person than I do on film, which is bad because it\'s how I make my living, but I am not a beauty and on balance I am glad.", Beauty

"We live in a state with a wonderful climate and plenty of natural beauty, from the shores of Cumberland Island to the Chattahoochee River to the Blue Ridge Mountains.", Beauty
"The beauty of jazz is that it\'s malleable. People are addressing it to suit their own personalities.", Beauty

"It used to happen in villages and towns in China that they would have - I guess you\'d call them beauty contests - where all of the women of a particular village or town would be seated behind these screens or curtains with only their feet showing.", Beauty
"Here in L.A. the standard of beauty is kind of ridiculous. I want to be doing this when I\'m in my fifties and sixties and this isn\'t what I\'m going to look like.", Beauty
"All I wanted was to connect my moods with those of Paris. Beauty paints and when it painted most, I shot.", Beauty

"An artist never really finishes his work, he merely abandons it.", Art
"All art is but imitation of nature.", Art
"If we could but paint with the hand what we see with the eye.", Art
"Very few people possess true artistic ability. It is therefore both unseemly and unproductive to irritate the situation by making an effort. If you have a burning, restless urge to write or paint, simply eat something sweet and the feeling will pass.", Art

"Great art picks up where nature ends.", Art
"A sad fact of life lately at the Museum of Modern Art is that when it comes to group shows of contemporary painting from the collection, the bar has been set pretty low.", Art
"The alchemy of good curating amounts to this: Sometimes, placing one work of art near another makes one plus one equal three. Two artworks arranged alchemically leave each intact, transform both, and create a third thing.", Art
"Everyone goes to the same exhibitions and the same parties, stays in the same handful of hotels, eats at the same no-star restaurants, and has almost the same opinions. I adore the art world, but this is copycat behavior in a sphere that prides itself on independent thinking.", Art
"Mission accomplished. The Museum of Modern Art\'s wide-open, tall-ceilinged, super-reinforced second floor was for all intents and purposes built to accommodate monumental installations and gigantic sculptures, should the need arise. It has arisen.", Art
"\'Summer of Love: Art of the Psychedelic Era,\' the Whitney Museum\'s 40th-anniversary trip down counterculture memory lane, provides moments of buzzy fun, but it\'ll leave you only comfortably numb. For starters, it may be the whitest, straightest, most conservative show seen in a New York museum since psychedelia was new.", Art
"I love to collect modern art.", Art
"Those who love him love that he sells the most art; they take it as a point of faith that this proves Kinkade is the best. But his fans don\'t only rely on this supply-and-demand justification. They go back to values.", Art
"The reason the art world doesn\'t respond to Kinkade is because none - not one - of his ideas about subject-matter, surface, color, composition, touch, scale, form, or skill is remotely original. They\'re all cliche and already told.", Art
"Kinkade\'s paintings are worthless schmaltz, and the lamestream media that love him are wrong. However, I\'d love to see a museum mount a small show of Kinkade\'s work. I would like the art world and the wider world to argue about him in public, out in the open.", Art
"Auction houses run a rigged game. They know exactly how many people will be bidding on a work and exactly who they are. In a gallery, works of art need only one person who wants to pay for them.", Art
"Artschwager\'s art always involves looking closely at surfaces, questions what an object is, wants to make you forget the name of the thing you\'re looking at so that it might mushroom in your mind into something that triggers unexpected infinities.", Art
"Early-twentieth-century abstraction is art\'s version of Einstein\'s Theory of Relativity. It\'s the idea that changed everything everywhere: quickly, decisively, for good.", Art
"The Metropolitan Museum of Art is unsurpassed at presenting more than 50 centuries of work. I go there constantly, seeing things over and over, better than I\'ve ever seen them before.", Art
"If the Frieze Art Fair catches on, I imagine at least two great things happening. First, we will once again have a huge art fair in town that isn\'t too annoying to go to. More importantly, Frieze may finally show New Yorkers that we can cross our own waters for visual culture. That would change everything.", Art
"Art is for anyone. It just isn\'t for everyone. Still, over the past decade, its audience has hugely grown, and that\'s irked those outside the art world, who get irritated at things like incomprehensibility or money.", Art
"I often find myself privately stewing about much British art, thinking that except for their tremendous gardens, that the English are not primarily visual artists, and are, in nearly unsurpassable ways, literary.", Art
"A metaphysical tour de force of untethered meaning and involuting interlocking contrapuntal rhythms, \'The Clock\' is more than a movie or even a work of art. It is so strange and other-ish that it becomes a stream-of-consciousness algorithm unto itself - something almost inhuman.", Art
"I don\'t know much about auctions. I sometimes go to previews and see art sardined into ugly rooms. I\'ve gawked at the gaudy prices, and gaped at well-clad crowds of happy white people conspicuously spending hundreds of millions of dollars.", Art
"I love art dealers. In some ways, they\'re my favorite people in the art world. Really. I love that they put their money where their taste is, create their own aesthetic universes, support artists, employ people, and do all of this while letting us see art for free. Many are visionaries.", Art
"When museums are built these days, architects, directors, and trustees seem most concerned about social space: places to have parties, eat dinner, wine-and-dine donors. Sure, these are important these days - museums have to bring in money - but they gobble up space and push the art itself far away from the entrance.", Art
"I see 30 to 40 gallery shows a week, and no matter what kind of mood I\'m in, no matter how bad the art is, I almost always feel better afterward. I can learn as much from bad art as from good.", Art
"Jeffrey Deitch is the Jeff Koons of art dealers. Not because he\'s the biggest, best, or the richest of his kind. But because in some ways he\'s the weirdest (which is saying a lot when you\'re talking about the wonderful, wicked, lovable, and annoying creatures known as art dealers).", Art
"Many say an art dealer running a museum is a \'conflict of interest.\' But maybe the art world has lived an artificial or unintentional lie all of these years when it comes to conflicts of interest.", Art
"Of course art world ethics are important. But museums are no purer than any other institution or business. Academics aren\'t necessarily more high-minded than gallerists.", Art
"We\'re all entitled to opinions about how art institutions should behave, and entitled to voicing those opinions through whatever means available to us. We\'re also allowed to change or modify our opinions.", Art
"The art of newspaper paragraphing is to stroke a platitude until it purrs like an epigram.", Art

"I don\'t like watching people work if they\'re making art.", Art
"The basis of art is truth, both in matter and in mode.", Art
"Art is one thing that can go on mattering once it has stopped hurting.", Art
"Of course the illusion of art is to make one believe that great literature is very close to life, but exactly the opposite is true. Life is amorphous, literature is formal.", Art
"I\'m very manipulative towards directors. My theory is that everyone on the set is directing the film, we\'re all receiving art messages from the universe on how we should do the film.", Art
"I\'m very much into the costuming of any character that I portray and it\'s one of the great things about making movies is it\'s a collaborative art form so you get all these artists who are looking specifically about for this instance your character\'s costume and what that might tell about your character.", Art
"Writing stopped being fun when I discovered the difference between good writing and bad and, even more terrifying, the difference between it and true art. And after that, the whip came down.", Art
"It\'s important to debunk the myths of Africa being this benighted continent civilized only when white people arrived. In fact, Africans had been creators of culture for thousands of years before. These were very intelligent, subtle and sophisticated people, with organized societies and great art.", Art
"It has taken me years of struggle, hard work and research to learn to make one simple gesture, and I know enough about the art of writing to realize that it would take as many years of concentrated effort to write one simple, beautiful sentence.", Art
"Intolerance respecting other people\'s religion is toleration itself in comparison with intolerance respecting other people\'s art.", Art
"I am an anarchist in politics and an impressionist in art as well as a symbolist in literature. Not that I understand what these terms mean, but I take them to be all merely synonyms of pessimist.", Art
"All good criticism should be judged the way art is. You shouldn\'t read it the way you read history or science.", Art
"Only in men\'s imagination does every truth find an effective and undeniable existence. Imagination, not invention, is the supreme master of art as of life.", Art
"I think it\'s pretentious to create art just for the sake of stroking the artists ego.", Art
"All art is exorcism. I paint dreams and visions too; the dreams and visions of my time. Painting is the effort to produce order; order in yourself. There is much chaos in me, much chaos in our time.", Art
"The art of the parenthesis is one of the greatest secrets of eloquence in Society.", Art
"Art is the human disposition of sensible or intelligible matter for an esthetic end.", Art
"The temple of art is built in words.", Art

"Film in the 20th century, it\'s the American art form, like jazz.", Art
"There are so many opportunities in life, that the loss of two or three capabilities is not necessarily debilitating. A handicap can give you the opportunity to focus more on art, writing, or music.", Art
"The art of living consists in knowing which impulses to obey and which must be made to obey.", Art
"It\'s only a few nutcases who do art for themselves, like Van Gogh.", Art

"The web of life is a beautiful and meaningless dance. The web of life is a process with a moving goal. The web of life is a perfectly finished work of art right where I am sitting now.", Art
"I never studied art, but taught myself to draw by imitating the New Yorker cartoonists of that day, instead of doing my homework.", Art
"I think no artist can claim to have any access to the truth, or an authentic version of an event. But obviously they have slightly better means at their disposal because they have their art to energize whatever it is they\'re trying to write about. They have music.", Art
"When you are learning about a martial art, it is about respect.", Art
"There is in fact no such thing as art for art\'s sake, art that stands above classes, art that is detached from or independent of politics. Proletarian literature and art are part of the whole proletarian revolutionary cause.", Art
"The art of effective listening is essential to clear communication, and clear communication is necessary to management success.", Art
"In an era ruled by materialism and unstable geopolitics, art must be restored to the center of public education.", Art
"If only life could be a little more tender and art a little more robust.", Art
"Politics is the art of the possible.", Art
"It seems almost backwards to me that my music seems the more emotional outlet, and the art stuff seems more about ideas.", Art
"I love fashion. I love couture. I\'m going to erect a shelf in my bedroom with an art light to be the spot for the shoes of the month.", Art
"I love prints of skulls and bones and have some taxidermy - a crow and a rabbit - to remind me of home. I like art and have a big portrait of Bjork.", Art
"All art is erotic.", Art
"Film is a very young art that is still evolving. Soon, we shall reach a balance between content and technology.", Art
"I think that is what film and art and music do; they can work as a map of sorts for your feelings.", Art
"Art is the symbol of the two noblest human efforts: to construct and to refrain from destruction.", Art
"When you live under the power of terror and segregation, you can\'t ever start a work of art.", Art
"There are so many reactions to art that make sense to me - but \'ick\' means something.", Art
"Insurrection is an art, and like all arts has its own laws.", Art
"The greatest work of art about New York? The question seems nebulous. The city\'s magic and majesty are distilled in the photographs of Alfred Stieglitz and Paul Strand.", Art
"Abstract Expressionism - the first American movement to have a worldwide influence - was remarkably short-lived: It heated up after World War II and was all but done for by 1960 (although visit any art school today and you\'ll find a would-be Willem de Kooning).", Art
"My culture-deprived, aspirational mother dragged me once a month from our northern suburb - where the word art never came up - to the Art Institute of Chicago. I hated it.", Art
"I\'m noticing a new approach to art making in recent museum and gallery shows. It flickered into focus at the New Museum\'s \'Younger Than Jesus\' last year and ran through the Whitney Biennial, and I\'m seeing it blossom and bear fruit at \'Greater New York,\' MoMA P.S. 1\'s twice-a-decade extravaganza of emerging local talent.", Art
"Outside museums, in noisy public squares, people look at people. Inside museums, we leave that realm and enter what might be called the group-mind, getting quiet to look at art.", Art
"It took the Metropolitan Museum of Art nearly 50 years to wake up to Pablo Picasso. It didn\'t own one of his paintings until 1946, when Gertrude Stein bequeathed that indomitable quasi-Cubistic picture of herself - a portrait of the writer as a sumo Buddha - to the Met, principally because she disliked the Museum of Modern Art.", Art
"Appropriation is the idea that ate the art world. Go to any Chelsea gallery or international biennial and you\'ll find it. It\'s there in paintings of photographs, photographs of advertising, sculpture with ready-made objects, videos using already-existing film.", Art
"After its hothouse incubation in the seventies, appropriation breathed important new life into art. This life flowered spectacularly over the decades - even if it\'s now close to aesthetic kudzu.", Art
"The New York art world readily proves people wrong. Just when folks say that things stink and flibbertigibbet critics wish the worst on us all because we\'re not pure enough, good omens appear.", Art
"Artistic qualities that once seemed undeniable don\'t seem so now. Sometimes these fluctuations are only fickleness of taste, momentary glitches in an artist\'s work, or an artist getting ahead of his audience (it took me ten years to catch up to Albert Oehlen). Other times, however, these problems mean there\'s something wrong with the art.", Art
"Can space break? I mean the space of art galleries. Over the past 100 years, art galleries have gone from looking like Beaux Arts salons to simple storefronts to industrial lofts to the gleaming giant white cubes of Chelsea with their shiny concrete floors.", Art
"It\'s great that New York has large spaces for art. But the enormous immaculate box has become a dated, even oppressive place. Many of these spaces were designed for sprawling installations, large paintings, and the Relational Aesthetics work of the past fifteen years.", Art
"The giant white cube is now impeding rather than enhancing the rhythms of art. It preprograms a viewer\'s journey, shifts the emphasis from process to product, and lacks individuality and openness. It\'s not that art should be seen only in rutty bombed-out environments, but it should seem alive.", Art
"It\'s art that pushes against psychological and social expectations, that tries to transform decay into something generative, that is replicative in a baroque way, that isn\'t about progress, and wants to - as Walt Whitman put it - \'contain multitudes.\'", Art
"Much good art got made while money ruled; I like a lot of it, and hardship and poverty aren\'t virtues. The good news is that, since almost no one will be selling art, artists - especially emerging ones - won\'t have to think about turning out a consistent style or creating a brand. They\'ll be able to experiment as much as they want.", Art
"When money and hype recede from the art world, one thing I won\'t miss will be what curator Francesco Bonami calls the \'Eventocracy.\' All this flashy \'art-fair art\' and those highly produced space-eating spectacles and installations wow you for a minute until you move on to the next adrenaline event.", Art
"A saboteur in the house of art and a comedienne in the house of art theory, Lawler has spent three decades documenting the secret life of art. Functioning as a kind of one-woman CSI unit, she has photographed pictures and objects in collectors\' homes, in galleries, on the walls of auction houses, and off the walls, in museum storage.", Art
"Works of art often last forever, or nearly so. But exhibitions themselves, especially gallery exhibitions, are like flowers; they bloom and then they die, then exist only as memories, or pressed in magazines and books.", Art
"If only we could persuade galleries to observe a fallow period in which, for two months every other year, new and old works of art could be sold in back rooms and all main galleries would be devoted to revisiting shows gone by.", Art
"A canon is antithetical to everything the New York art world has been about for the past 40 years, during which we went from being the center of the art world to being one of many centers.", Art
"It took me twenty years to get Steven Parrino\'s work. From the time I first saw his art, in the mid-eighties, I almost always dismissed it as mannered, Romantic, formulaic, conceptualist-formalist heavy-metal boy-art abstraction.", Art
"\'Untitled\' is a time machine that can transport you to 1992, an edgy moment when the art world was crumbling, money was scarce, and artists like Tiravanija were in the nascent stages of combining Happenings, performance art, John Cage, Joseph Beuys, and the do-it-yourself ethos of punk. Meanwhile, a new art world was coming into being.", Art
"Many art-worlders have an if-you-say-so approach to art: Everyone is so scared of missing out on the next hot artist that it\'s never clear whether people are liking work because they like it or because other people do. Everyone is keeping up with the Joneses, and there are more Joneses than ever.", Art
"Art is either plagiarism or revolution.", Art
"I\'ve been called many names like perfectionist, difficult and obsessive. I think it takes obsession, takes searching for the details for any artist to be good.", Art
"Lesser artists borrow, great artists steal.", Art
"Every artist writes his own autobiography.", Art
"Drawing is like making an expressive gesture with the advantage of permanence.", Art
"A sculptor is a person who is interested in the shape of things, a poet in words, a musician by sounds.", Art
"When I work, and in my art, I hold hands with God.", Art
"Art is the stored honey of the human soul, gathered on wings of misery and travail.", Art
"The perfection of art is to conceal art.", Art
"I choose a block of marble and chop off whatever I don\'t need.", Art
"Wherever art appears, life disappears.", Art
"An artist is never ahead of his time but most people are far behind theirs.", Art
"I don\'t think there\'s any artist of any value who doesn\'t doubt what they\'re doing.", Art
"Art is a revolt against fate. All art is a revolt against man\'s fate.", Art
"My hand is the extension of the thinking process - the creative process.", Art
"My painting does not come from the easel.", Art
"Every other artist begins with a blank canvas, a piece of paper the photographer begins with the finished product.", Art
"Time extracts various values from a painter\'s work. When these values are exhausted the pictures are forgotten, and the more a picture has to give, the greater it is.", Art
"I like to pretend that my art has nothing to do with me.", Art
"The creative act lasts but a brief moment, a lightning instant of give-and-take, just long enough for you to level the camera and to trap the fleeting prey in your little box.", Art
"All great art is born of the metropolis.", Art
"To make pictures big is to make them more powerful.", Art
"The beauty one can find in art is one of the pitifully few real and lasting products of human endeavor.", Art
"I\'ve never really had a hobby, unless you count art, which the IRS once told me I had to declare as a hobby since I hadn\'t made money with it.", Art
"The principles of true art is not to portray, but to evoke.", Art
"I think about my work every minute of the day.", Art
"Art hurts. Art urges voyages - and it is easier to stay at home.", Art
"Mournful and yet grand is the destiny of the artist.", Art
"Rationalism is the enemy of art, though necessary as a basis for architecture.", Art
"That\'s the motivation of an artist - to seek attention of some kind.", Art
"The artist one day falls through a hole in the brambles, and from that moment he is following the dark rapids of an underground river which may sometimes flow so near to the surface that the laughing picnic parties are heard above.", Art
"The artist\'s world is limitless. It can be found anywhere, far from where he lives or a few feet away. It is always on his doorstep.", Art
"Art doesn\'t transform. It just plain forms.", Art
"Painting is by nature a luminous language.", Art
"Artists don\'t make objects. Artists make mythologies.", Art
"My love of fine art increased - the more of it I saw, the more of it I wanted to see.", Art
"The principle of art is to pause, not bypass.", Art
"Vision is the true creative rhythm.", Art
"A painting that is well composed is half finished.", Art
"Beauty in art is often nothing but ugliness subdued.", Art
"To an engineer, good enough means perfect. With an artist, there\'s no such thing as perfect.", Art
"The works must be conceived with fire in the soul but executed with clinical coolness.", Art
"Art is the unceasing effort to compete with the beauty of flowers - and never succeeding.", Art
"Vitality is radiated from exceptional art and architecture.", Art
"The history of modern art is also the history of the progressive loss of art\'s audience. Art has increasingly become the concern of the artist and the bafflement of the public.", Art
"It is a mistake for a sculptor or a painter to speak or write very often about his job. It releases tension needed for his work.", Art
"Trying to force creativity is never good.", Art
"The writer, when he is also an artist, is someone who admits what others don\'t dare reveal.", Art
"When I think of art I think of beauty. Beauty is the mystery of life. It is not in the eye it is in the mind. In our minds there is awareness of perfection.", Art
"Art is an invention of aesthetics, which in turn is an invention of philosophers... What we call art is a game.", Art
"Playing a Fender is an art itself. They\'re always going out of tune.", Art
"I try to give people a different way of looking at their surroundings. That\'s art to me.", Art
"A copy of the universe is not what is required of art; one of the damned things is ample.", Art
"There is no logical reason why the camel of great art should pass through the needle of mob intelligence.", Art
"Art is I; science is we.", Art
"The problem is that once the rules of art are debunked, and once the unpleasant realities the irony diagnoses are revealed and diagnosed, \'then\' what do we do?", Art
"Fashion often starts off beautiful and becomes ugly, whereas art starts off ugly sometimes and becomes beautiful.", Art
"Art must take reality by surprise.", Art
"Although all the good arts serve to draw man\'s mind away from vices and lead it toward better things, this function can be more fully performed by this art, which also provides extraordinary intellectual pleasure.", Art
"What I\'m doing is art - it\'s low-brow art but there\'s a magic in that.", Art
"Politics is the art of the possible; creativity is the art of the impossible.", Art
"Wushu is a move in Chinese, a physical move. An attack. Wushu is like an art.", Art
"Good art provides people with a vocabulary about things they can\'t articulate.", Art
"Galleries began growing in both number and size in the late seventies, when artists who worked in lofts wanted to exhibit their work in spaces similar to the ones the art was made in.", Art
"There\'s something pleasing about large, well-lit spaces. I love that dealers are willing to take massive chances in order to give this much room to their artists. Most of all, I love that more galleries showing more art gives more artists a shot.", Art
"First let me report that the art in the Barnes Collection has never looked better. My trips to the old Barnes were always amazing, but except on the sunniest days, you could barely see the art. The building always felt pushed beyond its capacity.", Art
"Not to say people shouldn\'t get rich from art. I adore the alchemy wherein artists who cast a complex spell make rich people give them their money. (Just writing it makes me cackle.) But too many artists have been making money without magic.", Art
"Damien Hirst is the Elvis of the English art world, its ayatollah, deliverer, and big-thinking entrepreneurial potty-mouthed prophet and front man. Hirst synthesizes punk, Pop Art, Jeff Koons, Marcel Duchamp, Francis Bacon, and Catholicism.", Art
"Anyone who relishes art should love the extraordinary diversity and psychic magic of our art galleries. There\'s likely more combined square footage for the showing of art on one New York block - West 24th Street between Tenth and Eleventh Avenues - than in all of Amsterdam\'s or Hamburg\'s galleries.", Art
"Yes, 85 percent of the art you see isn\'t any good. But everyone has a different opinion about which 85 percent is bad. That in turn creates fantastically unstable interplay and argument.", Art
"Many museums are drawing audiences with art that is ostensibly more entertaining than stuff that just sits and invites contemplation. Interactivity, gizmos, eating, hanging out, things that make noise - all are now the norm, often edging out much else.", Art
"Imagine it\'s 1981. You\'re an artist, in love with art, smitten with art history. You\'re also a woman, with almost no mentors to look to; art history just isn\'t that into you. Any woman approaching art history in the early eighties was attempting to enter an almost foreign country, a restricted and exclusionary domain that spoke a private language.", Art
"Willem de Kooning is generally credited for coming out of the painterly gates strong in the forties, revolutionizing art and abstraction and reaching incredible heights by the early fifties, and then tailing off.", Art
"I also take pleasure in the so-called negative power in Grotjahn\'s work. That is, I love his paintings for what they are not. Unlike much art of the past decade, Grotjahn isn\'t simply working from a prescribed checklist of academically acceptable, curator-approved \'isms\' and twists.", Art
"It is not possible to overstate the influence of Paul Cezanne on twentieth-century art. He\'s the modern Giotto, someone who shattered one kind of picture-making and invented a new one that the world followed.", Art
"If a building becomes architecture, then it is art.", Art
"No heirloom of humankind captures the past as do art and language.", Art
"The artist who aims at perfection in everything achieves it in nothing.", Art
"Photography is a major force in explaining man to man.", Art
"When that shutter clicks, anything else that can be done afterward is not worth consideration.", Art
"I think an artist\'s responsibility is more complex than people realize.", Art
"Modern art is what happens when painters stop looking at girls and persuade themselves that they have a better idea.", Art
"Light in Nature creates the movement of colors.", Art
"Art in Nature is rhythmic and has a horror of constraint.", Art
"In an artwork you\'re always looking for artistic decisions, so an ashtray is perfect. An ashtray has got life and death.", Art
"Artists themselves are not confined, but their output is.", Art
"You begin with the possibilities of the material.", Art
"Murals in restaurants are on a par with the food in museums.", Art
"The more horrifying this world becomes, the more art becomes abstract.", Art
"Art is the desire of a man to express himself, to record the reactions of his personality to the world he lives in.", Art
"Culture is the arts elevated to a set of beliefs.", Art
"It is art that makes life, makes interest, makes importance and I know of no substitute whatever for the force and beauty of its process.", Art
"Art is subject to arbitrary fashion.", Art
"When I make art, I think about its ability to connect with others, to bring them into the process.", Art
"Every time a student walks past a really urgent, expressive piece of architecture that belongs to his college, it can help reassure him that he does have that mind, does have that soul.", Art
"I think of my peace paintings as one long poem, with each painting being a single stanza.", Art
"I paint with shapes.", Art
"Art ought never to be considered except in its relations with its ideal beauty.", Art
"I\'m not gonna give the British Government the joy of keeping taxing me. They don\'t tax art. And all my cars are just a collection of art.", Art
"I was the least Pop of all the Pop artists.", Art
"They teach you there\'s a boundary line to music. But, man, there\'s no boundary line to art.", Art
"The smart thing in the art world is to have one good idea and never have another.", Art
"I\'m not interested in pop art.", Art
"These days, newish art can be priced between $10,000 and $25,000. When I tell artists that a new painting by a newish artist should go for around $1,200, they look at me like I\'m a flesh-eating virus.", Art
"To engage with art, we have to be willing to be wrong, venture outside our psychic comfort zones, suspend disbelief, and remember that art explores and alters consciousness simultaneously.", Art
"While a large segment of the art world has obsessed over a tiny number of stars and their prices, an aesthetic shift has been occurring. It\'s not a movement - movements are more sure of themselves. It\'s a change of mood or expectation, a desire for art to be more than showy effects, big numbers, and gamesmanship.", Art
"Wisdom is nothing but a preparation of the soul, a capacity, a secret art of thinking, feeling and breathing thoughts of unity at every moment of life.", Art
"Art is the signature of civilizations.", Art
"Art allows people a way to dream their way out of their struggle.", Art
"I am still a victim of chess. It has all the beauty of art - and much more. It cannot be commercialized. Chess is much purer than art in its social position.", Art
"Customs and convictions change; respectable people are the last to know, or to admit, the change, and the ones most offended by fresh reflections of the facts in the mirror of art.", Art
"The screen is a magic medium. It has such power that it can retain interest as it conveys emotions and moods that no other art form can hope to tackle.", Art
"Art is anything people do with distinction.", Art
"People of art should never get married and have children, because it\'s a selfish experience.", Art
"The downfall of the industry seems to actually be good for art. I think the industry will find their way once the focus shifts from its greed-based origins, downsizes, and begins to support creative visions that speak to our times and shifting ideals.", Art
"The condition every art requires is, not so much freedom from restriction, as freedom from adulteration and from the intrusion of foreign matter.", Art
"Nothing is as dangerous in architecture as dealing with separated problems. If we split life into separated problems we split the possibilities to make good building art.", Art
"Politeness is the art of choosing among your thoughts.", Art
"A man is a poet if difficulties inherent in his art provide him with ideas; he is not a poet if they deprive him of ideas.", Art
"Teaching is not a lost art, but the regard for it is a lost tradition.", Art
"In art economy is always beauty.", Art

"Time is the coin of your life. It is the only coin you have, and only you can determine how it will be spent. Be careful lest you let other people spend it for you.", Time
"Time has been transformed, and we have changed; it has advanced and set us in motion; it has unveiled its face, inspiring us with bewilderment and exhilaration.", Time

"Until you value yourself, you won\'t value your time. Until you value your time, you will not do anything with it.", Time
"Time = Life, Therefore, waste your time and waste of your life, or master your time and master your life.", Time
"It is my feeling that Time ripens all things; with Time all things are revealed; Time is the father of truth.", Time
"What then is time? If no one asks me, I know what it is. If I wish to explain it to him who asks, I do not know.", Time
"For disappearing acts, it\'s hard to beat what happens to the eight hours supposedly left after eight of sleep and eight of work.", Time
"So during those first moments of the day, which are yours and yours alone, you can circumvent these boundaries and concentrate fully on spiritual matters. And this gives you the opportunity to plan the time management of the entire day.", Time

"The present is a point just passed.", Time
"I\'ve been a long time coming, and I\'ll be a long time gone. You\'ve got your whole life to do something, and that\'s not very long.", Time
"The way to work with a bully is to take the ball and go home. First time, every time. When there\'s no ball, there\'s no game. Bullies hate that. So they\'ll either behave so they can play with you or they\'ll go bully someone else.", Time
"In every adversity there lies the seed of an equivalent advantage. In every defeat is a lesson showing you how to win the victory next time.", Time

"As we celebrate Recovery Month, it is time for Congress to knock down the barriers to treatment and recovery for 26 million Americans suffering the ravages of alcohol and drug addiction.", Time
"The single most important thing in a child\'s performance is the quality of the teacher. Making sure a child spends the maximum amount of time with inspirational teachers is the most important thing.", Time
"Culture, what you believe, what you value, how you live matters. Now, as fundamental as these principles are, they may become topics of democratic debates from time to time, so it is today with the enduring institution of marriage. Marriage is a relationship between a man and a woman.", Time

"But whether it be dream or truth, to do well is what matters. If it be truth, for truth\'s sake. If not, then to gain friends for the time when we awaken.", Time
"Time is the substance from which I am made. Time is a river which carries me along, but I am the river; it is a tiger that devours me, but I am the tiger; it is a fire that consumes me, but I am the fire.", Time
"Only married people understand you can be miserable and happy at the same time.", Time
"Every time you cut programs, you take away a person who has a vested interest in high taxes and you put him on the tax rolls and make him a taxpayer. A farmer on subsidies is part welfare bum, whereas a free-market farmer is a small businessman with a gun.", Time
"If you look - look at - I mean, look at what\'s going on with your gasoline prices. They\'re going to go to $5, $6, $7 and we don\'t have anybody in Washington that calls OPEC and says, \'Fellas, it\'s time. It\'s over. You\'re not going to do it anymore.\'", Time

"The key is just to ignore the pain, because physical comedy only works if you see someone get hurt and they aren\'t actually hurt.

"Parents of recovered children, and I\'ve met hundreds, all share the same experience of doubters and deniers telling us our child must have never even had autism or that the recovery was simply nature\'s course. We all know better, and frankly we\'re too busy helping other parents to really care.", Nature

"I\'ve always regarded nature as the clothing of God.", Nature
"The private citizen, beset by partisan appeals for the loan of his Public Opinion, will soon see, perhaps, that these appeals are not a compliment to his intelligence, but an imposition on his good nature and an insult to his sense of evidence.", Nature
"To say to the painter that Nature is to be taken as she is, is to say to the player that he may sit on the piano.", Nature
"Since those who believe they need a hero/celebrity outnumber the actual heroes/celebrities, people feel safe and comfortably justified in numbers, committing egregious crimes in the name of the greater social ego. Ironically diminishing their own true hero-celebrity nature in the process.", Nature

"Human nature refers to what is in people but which they cannot study or work at achieving.", Nature

"The surest way to prevent war is not to fear it.", War
"I refuse to accept the view that mankind is so tragically bound to the starless midnight of racism and war that the bright daybreak of peace and brotherhood can never become a reality... I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word.", War

"A soldier will fight long and hard for a bit of colored ribbon.", War

"There is no avoiding war; it can only be postponed to the advantage of others.", War

"My point was that the war was intrinsically wrong, and as a result of our participation we haven\'t improved Australia\'s security but created a greater danger at home and abroad.", War
"Bush\'s war in Iraq has done untold damage to the United States. It has impaired our military power and undermined the morale of our armed forces. Our troops were trained to project overwhelming power. They were not trained for occupation duties.", War

"For the sake of the troops, for the love of the troops, we must not add yet another casualty to this war. We must not let truth be a casualty of this war.", War
"Detainee policy in this war is hard, it\'s complicated, but we must get it right. We would be better off as a nation if we could close Gitmo safely and start a new prison that he could use that the world would see as a better way to doing business.", War
"This war is like an actress who is getting old. It is less and less photogenic and more and more dangerous.", War
"One side-effect of the so-called war on terror has been a crisis of liberalism. This is not only a question of alarmingly illiberal legislation, but a more general problem of how the liberal state deals with its anti-liberal enemies.", War
"In a war, you must hate somebody or love somebody; you must have a position or you cannot stand what goes on.", War
"There is such a thing as legitimate warfare: war has its laws; there are things which may fairly be done, and things which may not be done.", War
"If it\'s just screaming - and I know this sounds so ridiculous - that gets old. But sometimes when there\'s literal chaos, it\'s like being in a war zone, and that\'s kind of exciting. You\'re just running through the crowd of people chasing after you and no one knows what\'s going on.", War
"I think the International Criminal Court could be a threat to American security interests, because the prosecutor of the court has enormous discretion in going after war crimes.

"Money is the sinews of love, as of war.", War
"We did an album one time called White Mansions, about the civil war, but it was written by a guy from England. His looking at it from over there and it not being a part of his history made it so he could be objective.", War
"The road ahead is not easy. Iraq is currently the center of the war on terror.", War
"Every child\'s taste is different. Don\'t worry if they\'re not reading \'War and Peace\' at age 12. First, build a good foundation and a positive attitude about reading by letting them pick the stories they enjoy. Make friends with a bookseller or librarian. They are a wealth of information on finding books that kids enjoy.", War

"My mother lived in Holland, and during World War II was incarcerated in a Japanese camp for three years.", War
"People have the problem of denial. This is one of the things I learned in Lebanon. Everybody who left Beirut when the war started, including my parents, said, \'Oh, its temporary.\' It lasted 17 years! People tend to underestimate the gravity of these situations. That\'s how they work.", War
"War - hard apprenticeship of freedom.", War
"A devastating commentary on the war in Iraq is that we have been unable to spend money on infrastructure.", War
"There is no morality in war. Morality is the privilege of those judging from the distance. War is only death and destruction.", War
"The west has a great deal to answer for in the Middle East, from Britain\'s belated empire-building after the First World War to the US and British policy that condemns modern Iraq to the material and social squalor of a half-century ago.", War

"Criticism in a time of war is essential to the maintenance of any kind of democratic government.", War
"Dropping those atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki was a war crime.", War

"I\'d like to see a world free of strife, stress, pain, hunger, war - a cool place where everyone could live.", War
"The siesta provides a delightful detour from the working day and it also has a practical value as far as productivity is concerned. Winston Churchill had a good long siesta every day during the Second World War, and he said it was the thing that enabled him to cope with the pressure.", War
"The Berlin Wall wasn\'t the only barrier to fall after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War. Traditional barriers to the flow of money, trade, people and ideas also fell.", War
"This nation has always struggled with how it was going to deal with poor people and people of color. Every few years you will see some great change in the way that they approach this. We\'ve had the war on poverty that never really got into waging a real war on poverty.", War
"President Bush has said that he does not need approval from the UN to wage war, and I\'m thinking, well, hell, he didn\'t need the approval of the American voters to become president, either.", War
"All the culture war issues will be settled by the court.", War
"During the Cold War, we were interested because we were scared that Russia and the United States were going to go to war. We were scared that Russia was going to take over the world. Every country became a battleground.", War
"The tactic of leading people into... a war that doesn\'t make any sense by telling them they are under attack, and if they raise any objection they\'re unpatriotic, is a very old tactic. And it doesn\'t intimidate me.", War

"The most successful war seldom pays for its losses.", War
"As long as war is regarded as wicked, it will always have its fascination. When it is looked upon as vulgar, it will cease to be popular.", War

"Communism has never come to power in a country that was not disrupted by war or corruption, or both.", War
"The first panacea for a mismanaged nation is inflation of the currency; the second is war. Both bring a temporary prosperity; both bring a permanent ruin. But both are the refuge of political and economic opportunists.", War
"If we are to teach real peace in this world, and if we are to carry on a real war against war, we shall have to begin with the children.", War
"It is our duty still to endeavor to avoid war; but if it shall actually take place, no matter by whom brought on, we must defend ourselves. If our house be on fire, without inquiring whether it was fired from within or without, we must try to extinguish it.", War
"I am never going to have anything more to do with politics or politicians. When this war is over I shall confine myself entirely to writing and painting.", War
"In war as in life, it is often necessary when some cherished scheme has failed, to take up the best alternative open, and if so, it is folly not to work for it with all your might.", War

"Economically considered, war and revolution are always bad business.", War
"War can really cause no economic boom, at least not directly, since an increase in wealth never does result from destruction of goods.", War
"It\'s good to focus on the universal suffering that goes on in any war. Whatever the right and wrongs of the war, there is always universal suffering.", War
"However much we may sympathize with a small nation confronted by a big and powerful neighbours, we cannot in all circumstances undertake to involve the whole British Empire in a war simply on her account.", War
"What we want to do is reform the welfare system in the way that Tony Blair talked about 13 years ago but never achieved - a system that was created for the days after the Second World War. That prize is now I think achievable.", War

"The belief in the possibility of a short decisive war appears to be one of the most ancient and dangerous of human illusions.", War
"I am one who believes that we are, in fact, engaged in a worldwide war against terrorism. We must have the serenity to accept the fact that war is not going to go away if we ignore it.", War
"I think that this is the first war in history that on the morrow the victors sued for peace and the vanquished called for unconditional surrender.", War
"People like to make fun of the fans who camp out but people have renaissance fairs; people do Civil War re-enactments; people do what they like. I\'m tired of hearing people rage on the fans. If you don\'t like \'Twilight,\' don\'t buy a ticket.", War
"Each one of these treaties is a step for the maintenance of peace, an additional guarantee against war. It is through such machinery that the disputes between nations will be settled and war prevented.", War
"There will always be disputes between nations which, at times, will inflame the public and threaten conflicts, but the main thing is to educate the people of the world to be ever mindful that there are better means of settling such disputes than by war.", War
"One nuclear war is going to be the last nuclear - the last war, frankly, if it really gets out of hand. And I just don\'t think we ought to be prepared to accept that sort of thing.", War
"My dear Excellency! I have not gone to war to collect cheese and eggs, but for another purpose.", War
"Even under the best of circumstances, the road back from war is difficult.", War
"It is not surprising that most Pakistanis do not support America\'s bombardment of Afghanistan. The Afghans are neighbours on the brink of starvation and devastated by war. America has shown itself to be untrustworthy, a superpower that uses its values as a scabbard for its sword.", War
"I think we need to look for any opening we can to avoid a war and we shouldn\'t pass up any opportunity for resolution.", War
"You cannot be politically correct in a war.", War
"In reality, Republicans have long been at war with clean energy. They have ridiculed investments in solar and wind power, bashed energy-efficiency standards, attacked state moves to promote renewable energy and championed laws that would enshrine taxpayer subsidies for fossil fuels while stripping them from wind and solar.", War
"Maybe more climate activists will think about the climate change not as an international problem to be resolved in an air-conditioned meeting hall, but as a guerilla war to be fought in the streets.", War

"Some argue that now isn\'t the time to push the green agenda - that all efforts should be on preventing a serious recession. That is a false choice.

I start at 6:30 or 7, and I\'ll write until 11, then take an hour off, then work until about 2 p.m. By then my brain has had enough.", Morning
"The cool thing about writing is that there is really never a typical day. Sometimes I get a rhythm going and head off to work every morning and come home at night. Sometimes I\'ll write for two days straight and then be utterly blank for the next two.", Morning

"I am so blessed to be able to get up in the morning and go to a job I love, with fantastic people around me.", Morning
"I\'m pretty much a 9-to-5 kind of guy. I usually get to work about 8 in the morning, and I work until 4 or 5, and sometimes I work on Saturday and Sunday mornings. Pretty much I keep the same hours as an accountant or clerk or whatever.", Morning

"You can\'t set a hen in one morning and have chicken salad for lunch.", Morning
"In a still hot morning, the tide went out and didn\'t come back in. This was not a spectacular event. The sea did not roll up like a scroll, like the sky in Revelations. It quietly withdrew.", Morning

"For 50 years, acting was the reason I got up in the morning.", Morning
"My mom was a big \'Smurfs\' fan, so she would force me to watch every Saturday morning. I had no choice in the matter. I would jump downstairs on Saturday morning, \'Hurray, cartoons!\' and she would say, \'Smurfs! That\'s what you\'re watching.\'", Morning
"I would bend over backward to be back on Grey\'s. Any day, I\'ll choose lying in bed with Katherine Heigl looking over me over getting thrown against walls by supernatural persons at 5 in the morning.", Morning
"My workout regimen at the moment is nonexistent. I wake up in the morning and brush my teeth. My toothbrush and deodorant are my only dumbbells. That\'s about it.", Morning

"When Andrew went with the girls, we were talking all morning and he was saying, \'It\'s okay. Just remember we had such a good day. Our wedding was so perfect.\' Because we\'re such a unit together. He made me feel very part of the day on April the 29th.", Morning

"I\'m not really a morning person.", Morning
"Four hours of makeup, and then an hour to take it off. It\'s tiring. I go in, I get picked up at two-thirty in the morning, I get there at three. I wait four hours, go through it, ready to work at seven, work all day long for twelve hours, and get it taken off for an hours, go home and go to sleep, and do the same thing again.", Morning

"My goal is to get home every day in time for dinner with the family - and then we play with the kids for a while, and then I go to bed around the time they do and sleep from nine to three or nine to four. It\'s the same six hours everyone else gets. I\'d just rather do my e-mails and my reading in the morning rather than late at night, that\'s all.", Morning

"I like to eat yogurt in the morning. It\'s easy and quick and available anywhere.", Morning
"There\'s pros and cons of a big church. Cons is I don\'t get to know everybody, I don\'t get to go to their ballgame, I don\'t get to marry everybody, but the pros are you get all this community, 800 ushers come in to serve, getting there at 7 in the morning on their day off and coming in on Saturday to make all those wafers.", Morning

That\'s how she found out what happened on the day my father died - she went looking for him because that morning, there was no rose.", Morning
"I think it\'s been hard for people to understand how Islam can be a good religion, and yet the Islamists are evil. Those of us who have had experience with Islam understand this, just as we understand the difference between snake handlers and people going to church on Sunday morning.", Morning

"Human life is as evanescent as the morning dew or a flash of lightning.", Morning
"On Sunday morning, I\'m not nervous... I can\'t wait to tell what God wants me to say.", Morning

"That\'s the trouble with being me. At this point, nobody gives a damn what my problem is. I could literally have a tumor on the side of my head and they\'d be like, \'Yeah, big deal. I\'d eat a tumor every morning for the kinda money you\'re pulling down.\'", Morning

"It is a matter of shame that in the morning the birds should be awake earlier than you.", Morning
"A bachelor is a man who comes to work each morning from a different direction.", Morning
"If you want to be an entrepreneur, it\'s not a job, it\'s a lifestyle. It defines you. Forget about vacations, about going home at 6 pm - last thing at night you\'ll send emails, first thing in the morning you\'ll read emails, and you\'ll wake up in the middle of the night. But it\'s hugely rewarding as you\'re fulfilling something for yourself.", Morning

"Culture and tradition have to change little by little. So \'new\' means a little twist, a marriage of Japanese technique with French ingredients. My technique.

"We need to accept the seemingly obvious fact that a toxic environment can make people sick and that no amount of medical intervention can protect us. The health care community must become a powerful political lobby for environmental policy and legislation.", Medical
"Remember, I\'m a doctor\'s daughter. So obviously I\'m interested in all medical things.", Medical
"Medical knowledge and technical savvy are biodegradable. The sort of medicine that was practiced in Boston or New York or Atlanta fifty years ago would be as strange to a medical student or intern today as the ceremonial dance of a !Kung San tribe would seem to a rock festival audience in Hackensack.", Medical
"The dilemma of modern medicine, and the underlying central flaw in medical education and, most of all, in the training of interns, is the irresistible drive to do something, anything. It is expected by patients and too often agreed to by their doctors, in the face of ignorance.", Medical

"Synergy and serendipity often play a big part in medical and scientific advances.", Medical

"And it was back in the mid-1980s, and as I point out in a piece, that was when we are spending about eight percent of our gross domestic product on health care. And even then, we had the impression that so much of the excessive, aggressive medical treatment that took place at the end of life was not only unnecessary but it was cruel.", Medical
"However, many skilled medical volunteers are turned away because community health centers cannot afford to cover their additional medical liability insurance.", Medical
"In the future, it\'s going to become more and more impossible for the economy to support how expensive medical care is and the number of sick people we have. Why don\'t we just get our population healthier so we don\'t need medical care?", Medical
"Why doesn\'t Apple stop for a year and make medical devices? When people talk about technology, that\'s where I start to get a little hot under the collar because I know that it\'s the key to solving some of the world\'s biggest problems.

"As a physician and a U.S. senator, I have warned since the very beginning about many troubling aspects of Mr. Obama\'s unprecedented health-insurance mandate.

"One of the most dangerous and best-kept secrets of the medical profession is the epidemic of anesthesiologists who are addicted to their own drugs.", Medical
"Accountants, machinists, medical technicians, even software writers that write the software for \'machines\' are being displaced without upscaled replacement jobs.

"Modern medical advances have helped millions of people live longer, healthier lives. We owe these improvements to decades of investment in medical research.", Medical
"Just the actual physical ability to hold four instruments simultaneously and do some of the things that Vivien was able to do is mind blowing to any surgeon. He never went to medical school and he became one of the great teachers of medicine himself, people are just amazed.", Medical
"The fact that he didn\'t get credit for a while is more the story of social injustice. But his own spirit wasn\'t driven by that, and wasn\'t dependent upon that. He just wished he had the cash to go to medical school.", Medical

"It\'s about communication. It\'s about honesty. It\'s about treating people in the organization as deserving to know the facts. You don\'t try to give them half the story. You don\'t try to hide the story. You treat them as - as true equals, and you communicate and you communicate and communicate.", Communication
"You know, Quincy Jones was a great mentor, but he was a man in a man\'s world. Fortunately he\'s a very sensitive man and a beautiful human being, and even though he was 14 or 15 years older than me, he\'s a capable human being and has great communication skills.", Communication

"With communication technology in general, there\'s a kind of certain critical mass of people. Once you get to 15% of the world\'s entire population using one communication technology, that\'s a big deal. It\'s beyond the theoretical at this point. The people who think it\'s a fad have probably not been paying that much attention.", Communication

"The government, for example, has determined that black people (somehow) have fewer abilities than white people, and, so, must be given certain preferences. Anyone acquainted with both black and white people knows this assessment is not only absurd but monstrous. And yet it is the law.", Government

"Thankfully, due to the United Kingdom and the commitment of the Westminster government we are able to ensure that money brought in, whether it be from the City of London or from North Sea oil, can be pooled and directed to wherever it is needed most.

"If you go from a structure where you have the support and that partner and that construction of a family and that\'s broken apart, I think that\'s probably a lot harder than always being a single mom and having the father being a support in another area.", Family
"There\'s always a wine bully. The one person who did read the \'Wine Spectator,\' who tells you what to drink and why the \'97 is better than the \'98. I want to punch the wine bully in the face. I want to make sure this generation of wine drinkers isn\'t elitist and snotty. I want it to be about family and bringing people together.", Family

"It\'s a little known fact that one in three family pets gets lost during its lifetime, and approximately 9 million pets enter shelters each year.

"When I am with my family, then I can just sort of switch off. It\'s kind of weird, because I go back and I go into this bedroom that I have had since I was a teenager. It is like this parallel universe, because one minute I am on the red carpet and then the next I am hiding out in this room I have had since I was 15.", Family

"What I want to do is tell stories about normal people in the American suburbs. I don\'t write the book where it\'s a conspiracy reaching the prime minister; I don\'t write the book with the big serial killer who lops off heads.

"While I have felt lonely many times in my life, the oddest feeling of all was after my mother, Lucille, died. My father had already died, but I always had some attachment to our big family while she was alive. It seems strange to say now that I felt so lonely, yet I did.", Family

"Touring is tough. You\'re almost in a haze because you don\'t really know where you are half the time: You\'re in a hotel room one moment, and the next thing you know, you\'re onstage performing for 60,000 people, then you\'re back on an airplane. It\'s very hectic and I couldn\'t do it without my family.", Family

"I\'m from a nice, suburban, middle-class family, but my tattoos remind me where I\'ve been.", Family
"Even though I have a nice house, nice family, the rest of my generation is still in South Central L.A. My cousins, my brothers, my sisters, they don\'t wanna move out. They don\'t want to and they don\'t have the means to sustain it. That\'s where my heart is and that\'s what I think about all the time.", Family
"Look, I\'ve got incredible pride for my family. I\'ve absolutely fallen into that cliche of a dad who could just happily talk about my daughter endlessly.", Family
"South Central is just who I am. Even though I have a nice house, nice family, the rest of my generation is still in South Central L.A. My cousins, my brothers, my sisters, they don\'t wanna move out.", Family
"There was a great complexity to my father. He was a devoted family man. But, in the same breath, he simply was not suited to an anchored life. He should have been somebody who had a backpack, an old map, a bit of change in his pocket and that was it - roaming the world.", Family

"I was always on the go, and thought I was too busy to develop something like this. I thought at the time that diabetes went along with bad habits, but I was the last one in my family to eat junk food.", Family
"I don\'t want to be reincarnated, that\'s for sure. When you\'ve had rewarding experiences in your life - a loving family, friends - you don\'t need additional reassurances that you\'re going to do something with a new cast of characters. I\'d just as soon pass.", Family
"My whole family is very sarcastic and constantly making jokes.", Family
"Family is the one thing that is definitely not disposable.", Family
"We need a better way to talk about eating animals, a way that doesn\'t ignore or even just shruggingly accept things like habits, cravings, family and history but rather incorporates them into the conversation. The more they are allowed in, the more able we will be to follow our best instincts.", Family
"The purpose of the Seder to my mind is to inspire conversations with your family about the human drama and hopefully transmit values to the next generation. I\'ve always felt like this could be better.", Family
"My family put a lot of emphasis on homework, so there weren\'t too many comic books or video games for me, when I was growing up.", Family
"I remember saying goodbye to my father the night he left to join the Navy. He didn\'t have to. He was older than other servicemen and had a family to support but he wanted to be a part of the fight against fascism, not just make movies about it. I admired this about him.", Family
"I went through a period of great rebellion within my family, when I was about 9 or 10. I was mad, I had no focus, had no real interest in anything, and so I started to do things that were just rebellious and stupid.", Family
"In my family, in the days prior to television, we liked to while away the evenings by making ourselves miserable, solely based on our ability to speak the language viciously.", Family

"We\'ll sort of get over the marriage first and then maybe look at the kids. But obviously we want a family so we\'ll have to start thinking about that.", Family
"The one thing that kept our family together was the music. The only thing that our family would share emotionally was to have our dad cry over something the kids did with music.", Family

"The extraordinary thing about India is that it\'s such a family place. It\'s full of families everywhere.", Family

"Pious XII was too neutral to mention the gas chambers; decent people like my own family were turned into devils by crude Christianity.", Family
"I want to be inspiring to myself, to my kids, my family, and my friends.", Family
"I was lucky. My family is wonderful. And it\'s funny, because most of my best friends come from very large families. So it always felt as if I had lots of siblings, though in the end I had to leave them and go home. I kind of got the best of both worlds as a kid.", Family
"For our immediate family and relatives, Canada was a land of opportunity.", Family
"Because sorry to say, women run the house. They run the family. They hold things up. I mean, it\'s like you don\'t ever see your mom get sick because she handles everything. And it\'s kind of amazing I think to show people just how strong women are.", Family
"This show has been a major revitalization of my family life and personal life. It gave my family an avenue to speak to me honestly.", Family

"I\'ve always known I wanted a family.", Family
"AP promoted me to the White House beat because I knew Clinton, his family, friends, and staff better than anybody in the national press corps. Those contacts helped me break a few stories and get my career in Washington jump-started.", Family

"Our family was on the lunatic fringe. My mother was always completely irrepressible. My father made crowd noises into a microphone.", Family
"Whole communities are growing up without fathers or male role models. Bringing up a family in the best of circumstances is not easy. To try to do it by placing the entire burden on women - 91% of single-parent families in Britain are headed by the mother, according to census data - is practically absurd and morally indefensible.", Family
"Make space in your life for the things that matter, for family and friends, love and generosity, fun and joy. Without this, you will burn out in mid-career and wonder where your life went.", Family

"We do not always appreciate the role the Queen has played in one of the most significant changes in the past 60 years: the transformation of Britain into a multi-ethnic, multi-faith society. No one does interfaith better than the Royal family, and it starts with the Queen herself.", Family
"Combined families often get bad reviews, but the family my children got when they traded away \'the suffocating four-person\' nuclear one is one that has benefited all of them.", Family
"Jews have deep respect for the Queen and the royal family. We say a prayer for them every Sabbath in synagogue. We recite a special blessing on seeing the Queen.", Family
"The only siblings I have are half-siblings. My nuclear family would have been an extra-suffocating threesome. Instead, I have an interesting brother and sister, in-laws, and darling nephews.", Family
"I have one friend that I\'ve had since I was born, and she\'s from Coatzacoalcos. She\'s not really impressed or interested in the actor\'s life. My family isn\'t really either.", Family
"The countries who do the best in international comparisons, whether it\'s Finland or Japan, Denmark or Singapore, do well because they have professional teachers who are respected, and they also have family and community which support learning.", Family

"Roots is not just a saga of my family. It is the symbolic saga of a people.", Family
"When you go to the movies with your whole family, it\'s a different experience. For some reason, it\'s something that you\'re all doing together and you take away something special in that.", Family

"I grew up in a family in which political issues were often discussed, and debated intensely.", Family
"My whole damn family was nice. I don\'t think I\'ve imagined it. It\'s true. Maybe it has to do with being brought up as Christian Scientists. Half of my relatives were Readers or Practitioners in the church.", Family
"My family background was deeply Christian.", Family
"The joke in our family is that we can cry reading the phone book.", Family
"We went to church every Sunday. When I was a kid, the only time I sang was around my family.", Family

"The other night I ate at a real nice family restaurant. Every table had an argument going.", Family
"My family, frankly, they weren\'t folks who went to church every week. My mother was one of the most spiritual people I knew but she didn\'t raise me in the church, so I came to my Christian faith later in life and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead.", Family

"No poems can please for long or live that are written by water drinkers.", Poetry
"Poetry is the synthesis of hyacinths and biscuits.", Poetry
"Poetry is the art of uniting pleasure with truth.", Poetry
"What does that represent? There was never any question in plastic art, in poetry, in music, of representing anything. It is a matter of making something beautiful, moving, or dramatic - this is by no means the same thing.", Poetry
"I didn\'t want to deal in poetry. I got rid of that after a few months.", Poetry
"Poetry criticism at its worst today is mean in spirit and spiteful in intent, as if determined to inflict the wound that will spur the artist to new heights if it does not cripple him or her.", Poetry

"He fertilizes a phrase or a line of poetry for weeks and then gives birth to it in a speech.", Poetry
"For a poet to depict a poet in poetry is a hazardous experiment; in regarding one\'s own trade a sense of humour and a little wholesome cynicism are not amiss.", Poetry
"How much money you get, depends on lots of extraneous things. It depends on how good you are at turning poetry into a marketable product, which is something it was never supposed to be. That\'s why many people suppose that the better the poet you are the lower your income should be, and that\'s probably true.", Poetry
"I think of something quite different from a snapshot. I know of a lot of poems, some very fine ones, that are like snapshots, but I\'m more interested in poetry that is like an endless film, long stories, things that weave together many different strands, like a big piece of cloth, not like a photograph.", Poetry
"I wrote The Green Eye of the Little Yellow God in five hours, but I had it all planned out. It isn\'t poetry and it does not pretend to be, but it does what it sets out to do.", Poetry
"Plagiarism has been around far longer than the Internet. In fact, I had a poem published in \'Seventeen\' magazine when I was 15 years old.

"I didn\'t attend the funeral, but I sent a nice letter saying I approved of it.", Death
"No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don\'t want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it.

"Individuals approaching death often experience encounters with their dead relatives, who seem to welcome them to the next world. These deathbed visions are authentic and convincing; they are often followed by a state of euphoria and seem to ease the transition.", Death

"Nobody with an IQ higher than emergency-room temperature could ever believe that \'death panels\' would be appointed to nudge the elderly toward euthanasia. Yet for idle entertainment, it\'s hard to beat Sarah Palin\'s ignorant nattering on the subject.", Death
"When you make a drama, you spend all day beating a guy to death with a hammer, or what have you. Or, you have to take a bite out of somebody\'s face. On the other hand, with a comedy, you yell at Billy Crystal for an hour, and you go home.", Death

"I think when you\'re 10 years old, it\'s too much to see something with the threat of death in every episode. Kids are better left naive about certain things.", Death

"To a billion people around the world surviving on just a dollar a day, the question of what to eat tonight is more about life and death than about recipes. The struggle of poor people around the globe weighs heavily on me, especially now that I am a mother, which is why I work with Oxfam.", Death

"I\'m trying to knock the medical profession into accepting its responsibilities, and those responsibilities include assisting their patients with death.", Death
"I was taught to confront things you can\'t avoid. Death is one of those things. To live in a society where you\'re trying not to look at it is stupid because looking at death throws us back into life with more vigour and energy. The fact that flowers don\'t last for ever makes them beautiful.", Death
"Since I was a child, death is definitely something that I think about every day. But I think that everybody does. You try and avoid it, but it\'s such a big thing that you can\'t.", Death

"If death is in the room, it\'s pretty interesting. But I would also say that I\'m interested in getting myself to believe that it\'s going to happen to me. I\'m interested in it, because if you\'re not, you\'re nuts. It\'s really de facto what we\'re here to find out about.", Death
"Death is the cure for all diseases.", Death

"The president of the United States let the consulate in Libya become a death trap.", Death
"The first novel I wrote was a monster - clocking in at 180,000 words - but it died a death, a death it deserved. It was called \'The Gods First Make Mad.\' It was a good title, but it was the only good thing about the book. I didn\'t let that put me off.", Death

"Washington, not Jefferson, freed his slaves upon his death.", Death
"Instead of joyfully looking forward to my birth, my mother began systematically preparing for her own death. She was fatalistic.", Death

"Death and life have their determined appointments; riches and honors depend upon heaven.", Death

"Why fear death? It is the most beautiful adventure in life.", Death
"It is not death, but dying, which is terrible.", Death

"Beauty is a precious trace that eternity causes to appear to us and that it takes away from us. A manifestation of eternity, and a sign of death as well.", Death
"There\'s really no such thing as the agony of dying. I\'m quite sure that pain is shut off at the moment of death. You see, something happens when the body knows it\'s about to go. Peptide hormones are released by cells in the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. Endorphins. They attach themselves to the cells responsible for feeling pain.", Death
"When we are dealing with death we are constantly being dragged down by the event: Humor diverts our attention and lifts our sagging spirits.", Death
"So we mustn\'t lower our guard in any sense because of what has happened in terms of the death of Osama Bin Laden and we are certainly not doing that. The terror threat level here in the U.K. remains at severe and we\'re very conscious of the need to continue that.", Death

"There are hundreds of Frank Lloyd Wright buildings around the United States and in other countries, too. Wright lived into his 90s, and one of his most famous buildings, the Guggenheim Museum in New York, was completed just before his death. Wright buildings look like Wright buildings - that is their paradox.", Death

"Nothing is absolute, with the debatable exceptions of this statement and death.", Death
"We weep over the graves of infants and the little ones taken from us by death; but an early grave may be the shortest way to heaven.", Death
"For a culture that has such a problem with death, we seem to deal with it in a quite bizarre way. We see people shot, killed and blown up, and we find it funny and sexy and all those things. But, the reality of it is that every day people die, and people are really sad and they grieve and they go through a really difficult process with it.", Death
"Death Valley is really wide-open - it\'s bigger than Rhode Island - and it\'s less a part of California than an ungoverned territory, so there\'s lots of weird cops-and-robbers stuff going on.", Death
"Our law is a Jordanian law that we inherited, which applies to both the West Bank and Gaza, and sets the death penalty for those who sell land to Israelis.", Death
"I just finished my homework fast, I was bored to death. There wasn\'t 500 channels so there was a thing for a librarian to teach a kid like me about reading. I started reading early and I read all the time, because I love it.", Death
"Since fame is an illusion and death is in our future all we have is the next moment before we are swallowed into oblivion.", Death
"Any film which views the darker side of life, which is death with a sense of humor, is very much to my taste.", Death
"One of the big questions in the climate change debate: Are humans any smarter than frogs in a pot? If you put a frog in a pot and slowly turn up the heat, it won\'t jump out. Instead, it will enjoy the nice warm bath until it is cooked to death. We humans seem to be doing pretty much the same thing.", Death
"People want the right to die at a time of their own choosing. Too many families have watched helplessly as a relative dies slowly, longing for death.", Death
"Life is a process of becoming, a combination of states we have to go through. Where people fail is that they wish to elect a state and remain in it. This is a kind of death.", Death

"The urge for good design is the same as the urge to go on living.", Design
"I don\'t design clothes, I design dreams.", Design
"Some men give up their designs when they have almost reached the goal; While others, on the contrary, obtain a victory by exerting, at the last moment, more vigorous efforts than ever before.", Design
"Design is the method of putting form and content together. Design, just as art, has multiple definitions; there is no single definition. Design can be art. Design can be aesthetics. Design is so simple, that\'s why it is so complicated.", Design
"It is only after years of preparation that the young artist should touch color - not color used descriptively, that is, but as a means of personal expression.", Design
"Everyone designs who devises courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones.", Design
"Good design is good business.", Design

"Design is an unknown.", Design

"A lot of people in our industry haven\'t had very diverse experiences. So they don\'t have enough dots to connect, and they end up with very linear solutions without a broad perspective on the problem. The broader one\'s understanding of the human experience, the better design we will have.", Design
"Design is the fundamental soul of a man-made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product or service. The iMac is not just the color or translucence or the shape of the shell. The essence of the iMac is to be the finest possible consumer computer in which each element plays together.", Design
"The design of the Mac wasn\'t what it looked like, although that was part of it. Primarily, it was how it worked. To design something really well, you have to get it. You have to really grok what it\'s all about. It takes a passionate commitment to really thoroughly understand something, chew it up, not just quickly swallow it.", Design
"In most people\'s vocabularies, design means veneer. It\'s interior decorating. It\'s the fabric of the curtains and the sofa. But to me, nothing could be further from the meaning of design.", Design
"In giving us children, God places us in a position of both leadership and service. He calls us to give up our lives for someone else\'s sake - to abandon our own desires and put our child\'s interests first. Yet, according to His perfect design, it is through this selflessness that we can become truly fulfilled.", Design
"The computer can\'t tell you the emotional story. It can give you the exact mathematical design, but what\'s missing is the eyebrows.", Design

"Since when has the world of computer software design been about what people want? This is a simple question of evolution. The day is quickly coming when every knee will bow down to a silicon fist, and you will all beg your binary gods for mercy.", Design

"There is a group of individuals who are radical jihadists. We need to call them by name. They believe it is OK to kill people in the name of their religion. It is not all of Islam. It is not all Muslims. But there is a subgroup who believe it is OK. In fact, it is their plan and design to kill people.", Design

"Clothes make the man. Naked people have little or no influence on society.", Society

"The human mind is a dramatic structure in itself and our society is absolutely saturated with drama.", Society
"My parents were really, really cool about supporting what I wanted to do at a really young age. I think I was about 10 when I caught the bug. They would drive me down to New York if there were auditions. When I was 12, I did this show on Broadway called \'High Society,\' so we moved to New York for the run of that.", Society
"We\'re in a period where society seems very attracted to flash, and that seeps into people\'s musical taste.", Society
"Same-sex marriage would eliminate entirely in law the basic idea of a mother and a father for every child. It would create a society which deliberately chooses to deprive a child of either a mother or a father.", Society

"Men must stop being jealous of their power and generously allow freedom and responsibility to others. The reward is harmonious families and society.", Society
"Every teenager deals in his or her own sexuality and has to face it and figure out how it can coincide with the rest of their lives in a healthy manner. And try to navigate it in our modern society, which is wrought with stigma and taboo and repression, and sort of as a result, these inner monsters that some teenagers really struggle with.", Society

"The British are supposed to be particularly averse to intellectuals, a prejudice closely bound up with their dislike of foreigners. Indeed, one important source of this Anglo-Saxon distaste for highbrows and eggheads was the French revolution, which was seen as an attempt to reconstruct society on the basis of abstract rational principles.", Society
"If we all say the same thing, then I think the government has to listen. But because no one is saying it, I become singled out, even though what I\'m saying is common sense. It\'s very essential values that we all have to protect. But in Chinese society, people are giving up on protecting these values.", Society
"Police in China can do whatever they want; after 81 days in arbitrary detention you clearly realise that they don\'t have to obey their own laws. In a society like this there is no negotiation, no discussion, except to tell you that power can crush you any time they want - not only you, your whole family and all people like you.", Society
"He who negates present society, and seeks social conditions based on the sharing of property, is a revolutionary whether he calls himself an anarchist or a communist.", Society

"I don\'t think anyone in the media thinks strategically about society.", Society
"It\'s a rare and precious thing to be close to suffering because our society - in many ways - tells us that suffering is wrong. If it\'s our own suffering, we try to hide it or isolate ourselves. If others are suffering, we\'re taught to put them away somewhere so we don\'t have to see it.", Society
"We coin concepts and we use them to analyse and explain nature and society. But we seem to forget, midway, that these concepts are our own constructs and start equating them with reality.", Society

"In the 18th century, James Hargreaves invented the Spinning Jenny, and Richard Arkwright pioneered the water-propelled spinning frame which led to the mass production of cotton.

"If society will not admit of woman\'s free development, then society must be remodeled.", Society
"I understand why society, especially American society, is gravitating toward fairy tales, given our economy. We\'ve been exploring the world of witches and wizards for years.

"One of the great responsibilities we have as a society is to educate ourselves, along with the next generation, about which substances are worth ingesting, and for what purpose, and which are not.", Society

"I didn\'t become leader to transform the Liberal Democrats into an enlarged form of the Electoral Reform Society. It\'s not the be all and end all for us.

"There\'s a lot of conning as part of our society, I think.", Society
"Kids are going to try drugs and alcohol; that\'s part of society.", Society
"Sweden is still a very peaceful country to live in. I think that people in Britain have created this mythology about Sweden, that it\'s a perfect democratic society full of erotically charged girls.", Society
"I work in an old tradition that goes back to the ancient Greeks. You hold a mirror to crime to see what\'s happening in society. I could never write a crime story just for the sake of it, because I always want to talk about certain things in society.", Society

"When people ask me, \'Are you happy?\' I respond with, \'You\'ve asked the wrong question.\' There is a deep kind of satisfaction you get from building a company. This kind of satisfaction transcends happy, sad, hard, or easy. I seek satisfaction. I want to be positively disruptive.", Sad

"It\'s sad that women characters have lost so much ground in popular movies. Didn\'t \'Thelma and Louise\' prove that women want to see women doing things on film? Thelma and Louise were in a classic car; they were being chased by cops; they shot up a truck - and women loved it.", Sad
"The pro athlete is a sad tale. He signs a big contract and thinks he\'s set for life. I didn\'t think I was set for life, and I don\'t now.

"Nolan has the strangest affect on people. You know, I think there\'s something very sad and little boy about him, but at the same time the way he goes about everything is so awkward and obnoxious.

"Since it\'s based on my parents, it\'s more emotionally close to me than some of my more surreal plays. And then I like the balance of the comic and the sad. It should play as funny, but you should care about the characters and feel sad for them.", Sad
"My acting\'s very understated. I think my sad and happy don\'t play that differently onscreen.", Sad
"I think it\'s a terrible thing to write and not enjoy it. It\'s a sad thing. But of course a lot of people do work because they need to eat. And we all need to eat, but that\'s not the only reason to work. You couldn\'t have paid me not to write.", Sad

"I did \'Lone Star Love\' in 2007 with Randy Quaid, and that was supposed to come to Broadway at the Belasco and a marquee went up and everything... and it all fell apart, and that marquee came right down, and we got severance pay. And, it was very sad.", Sad
"I\'ve had tons of bullies who would call me retarded, even on my Facebook page. It\'s sad and it really hurts. I want to tell people not to use the word.

"With Facebook, you\'re not really allowed to be unhappy. Think about it: There\'s only a like button. Yes, you can be angry, but it\'s only lighthearted rage. On Reddit, perhaps because you can be anonymous, people are willing to be openly sad or angry. They are more honest.", Sad
"A Church which has lost its memory is in a sad state of senility.", Sad
"I think it\'s sad that movies and television have caused the theatre to fade as a popular art form. I hope to get young people into the theatre and expose them to Shakespeare.", Sad

"Family trips to Yellowstone and to what are now national parks in Southern Utah, driving the primitive roads and cars of that day, were real adventures.", Car
"Parisians overwhelmingly buy small cars. And it\'s not because people are petite, but because fuel is drop-dead expensive. Gasoline costs more than twice as much in Paris as in New York.", Car

"No illusion is more crucial than the illusion that great success and huge money buy you immunity from the common ills of mankind, such as cars that won\'t start.", Car
"I am a big car enthusiast. I totally understand guys like Jay Leno who have a thousand cars. But asking me my favorite car would be like asking my favorite song or favorite food - it changes everyday.", Car
"See, what you\'re meant to do when you have a mid-life crisis is buy a fast car, aren\'t you? Well, I\'ve always had fast cars. It\'s not that. It\'s the fear that you\'re past your best. It\'s the fear that the stuff you\'ve done in the past is your best work.", Car

"I compare it to being in a car accident. There\'s so much adrenaline rushing through you that you remember being in the accident but you don\'t remember any of the details.", Car
"I think it\'s particularly a distinctively American concept that resonates with American culture through biker culture. A motorcycle is an independent thing. You\'re like, \'I don\'t want to ride in a car with this person. I want to be independent and ride by myself. But, let\'s ride in a group. Let\'s be independent, together.\'", Car
"Those youngsters go out there and set a record and clinch the pole position. But what do you do if you wreck your car. That record doesn\'t spend too well.", Car

"Fast cars are my only vice.", Car
"Consider what kind of car you get. Buy cars and other products that have the least impact environmentally.", Car
"I\'ve always been attracted to cars, and driving is a completely measurable experience: if you qualify last on the grid, you\'re the slowest, and if you qualify first on the grid, you\'re the fastest. So no one can say you\'re slow if you\'re fast and no one can say you\'re fast if you\'re slow.", Car

"I have a need to make these sorts of connections literal sometimes, and a vehicle often helps to do that. I have a relationship to car culture. It isn\'t really about loving cars. It\'s sort of about needing them.", Car
"I drive Fords, and I\'ve driven American cars all my life, and I want to have a strong American manufacturing sector, especially in automobiles.", Car
"In the last three years of racing I\'ve met as many women fans as men fans, and in NASCAR it\'s the same thing. My wife loves cars, but the difference is she doesn\'t have 20 years of understanding the background of them. She basically drives them and uses her gut feelings as to which is best.", Car
"The automobile engine will come, and then I will consider my life\'s work complete.", Car
"I\'ve actually made a prediction that within 30 years a majority of new cars made in the United States will be electric. And I don\'t mean hybrid, I mean fully electric.", Car

"More books, more racing and more foolishness with cars and motorcycles are in the works.", Car
"Why did they keep changing guitars and amplifiers when they were perfect? They did the same things with cars, if you ask me. They forgot how to make them right, because they focused on style and bells and whistles.", Car

"Electric cars aren\'t pollution-free; they have to get their energy from somewhere.", Car
"I love vintage cars because you can do so much more to them.", Car

"I\'m starting to think about things that I want to do, things that are fun. One of them is driving a car like a Porsche. I\'ve driven a lot of cars - sedans, trucks and big family vehicles all year long. But there\'s nothing like a four-wheel-drive Porsche.", Car

"You have to wait six months to purchase a fuel efficient automobile made from overseas.", Car

They were made possible by the financial architecture, the capital intensive operations invented and developed by the Anglo-Americans.", Car

"You are not going to get peace with millions of armed men. The chariot of peace cannot advance over a road littered with cannon.", Peace
"To many men... the miasma of peace seems more suffocating than the bracing air of war.", Peace
"In a tribal organization, even in time of peace, service to tribe or state predominates over all self seeking; in war, service for the tribe or state becomes supreme, and personal liberty is suspended.", Peace

"The first of the four noble truths of Buddhism, that there is suffering in life, was enormously important to me. No one had ever said it out loud. That had been my experience, of course, but no one had ever talked about it. I didn\'t know what to do with all the fear and emotions within, and here was the Buddha saying this truth right out loud.", Experience
"To remember non-attachment is to remember what freedom is all about. If we get attached, even to a beautiful state of being, we are caught, and ultimately we will suffer. We work to observe anything that comes our way, experience it while it is here, and be able to let go of it.", Experience
"In a single moment we can understand we are not just facing a knee pain, or our discouragement and our wishing the sitting would end, but that right in the moment of seeing that knee pain, we\'re able to explore the teachings of the Buddha. What does it mean to have a painful experience? What does it mean to hate it, and to fear it?", Experience
"Doing nothing means unplugging from the compulsion to always keep ourselves busy, the habit of shielding ourselves from certain feelings, the tension of trying to manipulate our experience before we even fully acknowledge what that experience is.", Experience
"We certainly want those at the top to do well, but if you base your entire presidency and your entire economic platform on helping them do even better, you\'re missing what makes the economy tick. Because not everyone has been as fortunate as Mitt Romney, you cannot base your whole approach on a life experience as rarified as his.", Experience
"Meditation is not the construction of something foreign, it is not an effort to attain and then hold on to a particular experience. We may have a secret desire that through meditation we will accumulate a stockpile of magical experiences, or at least a mystical trophy or two, and then we will be able to proudly display them for others to see.", Experience
"There are many reasons why Mitt Romney should not become president, but perhaps the most important of all is the narrowness of his experience, perspective and vision.", Experience
"I had the closest thing I have ever had to an out-of-body experience lying in bed one morning. I turned on the \'Today\' programme and item four on the news was: \'The shadow chancellor has ruled himself out of the leadership.\' I lay there thinking that\'s interesting, then I realised it was me.", Experience
"Protection, as we use the word in Buddhism, is actually wisdom, it\'s insight. Protection is seeing and knowing deeply that all things in our experience arise due to causes, due to conditions coming together in a certain way.", Experience
"From the Buddhist point of view, it is true that emptiness is a characteristic of all of life - if we look carefully at any experience we will find transparency, insubstantiality, with no solid, unchanging core to our experience. But that does not mean that nothing matters.", Experience
"In my experience an appreciative letter from a fellow writer means a lot.", Experience
"You know, one wonderful thing that came out of my Enquirer experience is that, in my case, it was ruled tabloids are magazines. Which means they didn\'t have the protection that a newspaper has.", Experience
"A twenty-one-year-old writer is likely to be inhibited by a lack of usable experience. Childhood and adolescence were something I knew.", Experience
"The use of the term art medium is, to say the least, misleading, for it is the artist that creates a work of art not the medium. It is the artist in photography that gives form to content by a distillation of ideas, thought, experience, insight and understanding.", Experience
"Most people do not consider dawn to be an attractive experience - unless they are still up.", Experience
"When he brought it to me four years ago, Rodney King had just arrived, I was involved in the clean-up of L.A. and I guess it was part of my experience.", Experience
"You know, artists don\'t really have all that much experience of life. We make a huge amount out of the small experience that we do have.", Experience
"When I design buildings, I think of the overall composition, much as the parts of a body would fit together. On top of that, I think about how people will approach the building and experience that space.", Experience
"We have all had the experience of finding that our reactions and perhaps even our deeds have denied beliefs we thought were ours.", Experience
"It is brilliant going to the theatre and being forced to sit and listen and think about life. It can be almost a near-religious experience.", Experience
"My kids will grow up in a house knowing that it\'s perfectly normal for two men to be in love, it\'s perfectly normal for two women to be in love. My kids will grow up knowing it\'s all about love. It doesn\'t matter who you\'re with and everyone should have that experience.", Experience
"I think women don\'t grow up with the harsh world of criticism that men grow up with, we are more sensitively treated, and when you first experience the world of film-making you have to develop a very tough skin.", Experience
"With \'Bright Star\' and with \'The Piano,\' too, I felt a kind of sadness about it being in such a different era, because of my lack of experience with the era. And one of the ways I\'d get over it is to remind myself that every film, even if it\'s contemporary, creates its own world.", Experience
"I experience God as the power of love.", Experience
"I\'m a very professional man. I\'m not out for the experience of adventure.", Experience

"All that I know I learned after I was thirty.", Experience
"All experience is an arch wherethrough gleams that untravelled world whose margin fades for ever and for ever when I move.", Experience

"Experience comprises illusions lost, rather than wisdom gained.", Experience
"Experience is a great teacher.", Experience
"If you want to know the taste of a pear, you must change the pear by eating it yourself. If you want to know the theory and methods of revolution, you must take part in revolution. All genuine knowledge originates in direct experience.", Experience
"Experience has taught me, when I am shaving of a morning, to keep watch over my thoughts, because, if a line of poetry strays into my memory, my skin bristles so that the razor ceases to act.", Experience
"All experience is an arch, to build upon.", Experience
"Experiences are savings which a miser puts aside. Wisdom is an inheritance which a wastrel cannot exhaust.", Experience
"The main thing experience has taught me is that one has to sort of hone their relationship to time, you know.", Experience
"Few people even scratch the surface, much less exhaust the contemplation of their own experience.", Experience
"Judgment comes from experience - and experience comes from bad judgment.", Experience
"I think we are a product of all our experiences.", Experience
"Most of the images of reality on which we base our actions are really based on vicarious experience.", Experience
"Information\'s pretty thin stuff unless mixed with experience.", Experience

"Color is an intense experience on its own.", Experience
"Not the fruit of experience, but experience itself, is the end.", Experience
"One thorn of experience is worth a whole wilderness of warning.", Experience
"The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science.", Experience
"Security is mostly a superstition. It does not exist in nature, nor do the children of men as a whole experience it. Avoiding danger is no safer in the long run than outright exposure. Life is either a daring adventure, or nothing.", Experience
"Happiness cannot be traveled to, owned, earned, worn or consumed. Happiness is the spiritual experience of living every minute with love, grace, and gratitude.", Experience
"Experience demands that man is the only animal which devours his own kind, for I can apply no milder term to the general prey of the rich on the poor.", Experience
"Never, never and never again shall it be that this beautiful land will again experience the oppression of one by another.", Experience
"My experience has been that work is almost the best way to pull oneself out of the depths.", Experience
"Let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion. Reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle.", Experience
"Be brave. Take risks. Nothing can substitute experience.", Experience
"I believe that anyone can conquer fear by doing the things he fears to do, provided he keeps doing them until he gets a record of successful experience behind him.", Experience
"We choose our joys and sorrows long before we experience them.", Experience
"Unwearied ceaseless effort is the price that must be paid for turning faith into a rich infallible experience.", Experience
"Experience teaches us that it is much easier to prevent an enemy from posting themselves than it is to dislodge them after they have got possession.", Experience
"The marvelous richness of human experience would lose something of rewarding joy if there were no limitations to overcome. The hilltop hour would not be half so wonderful if there were no dark valleys to traverse.", Experience
"Many people know so little about what is beyond their short range of experience. They look within themselves - and find nothing! Therefore they conclude that there is nothing outside themselves either.", Experience
"I think theatre is by far the most rewarding experience for an actor. You get 4 weeks to rehearse your character and then at 7:30 pm you start acting and nobody stops you, acting with your entire soul.", Experience
"I had great faith in Irish actors, that they\'d be hip to the whole theatre thing, and they are. I had no illusions of coming over here as some kind of big shot. It\'s been a learning experience for me too.", Experience
"One of the things in the back of my mind is that, after my sports experience, I never want to be, totally consumed by any one endeavor, other than my family life.", Experience
"Before this learning experience, I had assumed that with regard to programs that sought to help people out of poverty, the political world was essentially divided into two camps: conservatives who opposed these for a variety of reasons, and liberals who supported them.", Experience
"While I was pleasantly surprised by the relatively high number of jobs created in April, the fact is that job creation during this recovery period has significantly lagged both historical experience in recovery, and the projections of the Bush Administration.", Experience
"When I was thin, I had no notion of what being fat is like. When I worked in a department store, I had sold clothes to women of most sizes, so I should have known; but perhaps you have to experience the state from the inside, to understand what fat is like.", Experience
"History offers us vicarious experience. It allows the youngest student to possess the ground equally with his elders; without a knowledge of history to give him a context for present events, he is at the mercy of every social misdiagnosis handed to him.", Experience
"I talked to members of my family, and did some personal research that didn\'t really have anything to do with the time and place I was writing about, but that gave me a feeling of the experience of being black in a time and place where it was very difficult to be black.", Experience
"I think Anna and the King is a look at Asia from the Asian perspective, reflecting the Asian experience, which is very rare.", Experience
"I\'m a method writer. In order to write about the emotion, I have to experience it. I get physically tired and exhausted, devoting hours and hours and hours to it.", Experience
"In the past goodness was always a collective experience. Then goodness became privatised.", Experience
"If I\'m going to do television, I wanted that \'North and South\' experience. I wanted something that\'s going to challenge me on a constant basis.", Experience
"I wouldn\'t go up on a stage now if you paid a thousand dollars for one minute of acting. It\'s a nasty experience. You\'re up there all by yourself. You\'re so damn exposed.", Experience
"I would vote for the man who\'s lived life, who\'s done different occupations, who\'s been out in the real world and struggled to make a living, struggled to raise a family, struggled with life as it exists. So I\'d vote for experience, honest experience.", Experience
"A lot of people fear death because they think that so overwhelming an experience has to be painful, but I\'ve seen quite a few deaths, and, with one exception, I\'ve never known anyone to undergo anything like agony. That\'s amazing when you think about it. I mean, how complicated the mechanism is that\'s being taken apart.", Experience
"My time at Shell was a most valuable experience because it taught me to look at the world in a long-term way. Shell takes a 20-year view on events and plans for different scenarios. It makes you see the world as a kind of large matrix.", Experience
"I\'ve had a fair amount of experience with snakes, and I find them to be pretty honest in terms of how you read their body language and emotions. They\'ll tell you when they\'re grumpy. They\'ll tell you when they\'re okay.", Experience
"If you build that foundation, both the moral and the ethical foundation, as well as the business foundation, and the experience foundation, then the building won\'t crumble.", Experience
"I loved making Pure Country. It was a great learning experience for me, seeing another part of the entertainment industry.", Experience
"The course of the flight up and down was exceedingly erratic, partly due to the irregularity of the air, and partly to lack of experience in handling this machine. The control of the front rudder was difficult on account of its being balanced too near the center.", Experience
"The roles... the deep roles that I\'ve gotten to play have turned my course. They\'ve changed my life experience.", Experience
"I think most artists will experience a lot of negative people on Twitter but, thank God, I\'ve got so many followers that I\'m not able to see them that much. I\'ll see some from time to time but, for the most part, I always focus on something good.", Experience
"I\'m more interested in the meaning of funerals and the mourning that people do. It\'s not a retail experience. It\'s an existential one.", Experience
"Teaching children about entrepreneurship is much like imparting any other skill or piece of knowledge. You will provide them with ways to experience how entrepreneurship works, and you guide them toward the subjects or areas they seem to show an interest in.", Experience
"Whatever it is you want to do, take a job in that field. You will learn by experience and, slow and steady, you\'ll get it done!", Experience
"Working with and collaborating with and for Peter Jackson was an incredible experience because he is such a phenomenal filmmaker.", Experience
"I would love to be a father. I had a great father who taught me how gratifying that is. I\'m not going to deny myself that. I think I\'d be good at it. Everybody wants that experience. I definitely do.", Experience
"What our men and women in uniform are doing is providing for the Iraqi people and other surrounding nations the opportunity to see, to taste and to experience the democracy that equals freedom and ultimately justice.", Experience
"Experience, already reduced to a group of impressions, is ringed round for each one of us by that thick wall of personality through which no real voice has ever pierced on its way to us, or from us to that which we can only conjecture to be without.", Experience
"The act of writing... is the act of trying to understand why my opinion is what it is. And ultimately, I think that\'s the same experience the reader has when they pick up one of my books.", Experience
"When they call the slightest spending reductions \'painful\', we will say \'If government spending prevents pain, why are we suffering so much of it?\' And \'If you want to experience real pain, just stay on the track we are on.\'", Experience
"Working with great people makes you great; you learn a lot and it also gives you the experience and confidence to move on with your own career.", Experience
"It was a great experience for a kid, because it was a bunch of kids playing on pirate ships and water slides, so looking back on it, it was the fondest experience of my childhood.", Experience
"Films that are entertainments give simple answers but I think that\'s ultimately more cynical, as it denies the viewer room to think. If there are more answers at the end, then surely it is a richer experience.", Experience
"I am very happy since when I am in different cities I can experience and learn different cultures!", Experience
"You can use your means in a good and bad way. In German-speaking art, we had such a bad experience with the Third Reich, when stories and images were used to tell lies. After the war, literature was careful not to do the same, which is why writers began to reflect on the stories they told and to make readers part of their texts. I do the same.", Experience
"You know, I\'ve learned a lot from every person I\'ve collaborated with, from Madlib to Jean Grae and Hi-Tek, to Mos to DJ Quik, to even somebody like Jermaine Dupri. I\'ve taken something important away from every experience.", Experience
"Many children are natural fantasists, I think, perhaps because their imaginations have yet to be clobbered into submission by experience.", Experience
"The world is given to me only once, not one existing and one perceived. Subject and object are only one. The barrier between them cannot be said to have broken down as a result of recent experience in the physical sciences, for this barrier does not exist.", Experience
"I had 30-something years\' experience in modeling, which is rare.", Experience
"From my experience, politicians are much more uncomfortable being made fun of than they are being preached at and screeched at - you know, and the soapbox routine. They\'re much more uneasy knowing they\'re a target of ridicule.", Experience
"Walk to work, even if it\'s four miles. Ride a bike to work. Drive a different way. On your way there, try to find beauty. You\'d be surprised how much more of the neighborhood you can perceive and experience when you\'re looking for unique spots of beauty.", Experience
"In the United States, we spend millions of dollars on sports because it promotes teamwork, discipline, and the experience of learning to make great progress in small increments. Learning to play music does all this and more.", Experience
"I don\'t think as a creator that I could create an experience that truly feels interactive if you don\'t have something to hold in your hand, if you don\'t have something like force feedback that you can feel from the controller.", Experience
"Games have grown and developed from this limited in-the-box experience to something that\'s everywhere now. Interactive content is all around us, networked, ready. This is something I\'ve been hoping for throughout my career.", Experience
"Bringing an end to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians may help the young Arab generation to realise their aspirations. Israel is more than willing to offer our experience in building a modern economy in spite of limited resources to the whole region.", Experience
"Have you ever watched someone become American? Last week, at a national citizenship conference I organize, thirty immigrants from 17 countries swore an oath and became citizens of the United States. It was a stirring experience for the hundreds of people in the room.", Experience
"But beginners to the World Economics Forum have to understand there is no single Davos experience, and there is no single Davos community either. There are numerous tribes who interact only at a minimal level.", Experience
"Someone who has experienced trauma also has gifts to offer all of us - in their depth, their knowledge of our universal vulnerability, and their experience of the power of compassion.", Experience
"I\'ve learned through experience of playing different characters, some of whom were jerks, that when you play a character who is pretentious or obnoxious, in any way, it\'s important to knock them down a peg.", Experience
"Each time you do a film you gain a lot of experience and build a visual resume where people get to know who you are.", Experience
"That\'s one of the benefits of working on big budget films. You work with people who have a lot of experience and you get to learn a lot.", Experience
"Great art - or good art - is when you look at it, experience it and it stays in your mind. I don\'t think conceptual art and traditional art are all that different.", Experience
"The president felt that it was important to send an ordinary citizen to experience the excitement of space travel as a representative for all Americans.", Experience
"We have that illusion that we are \'deciding\' what to make a character do, in order to \'convey our message\' or something like that. But, at least in my experience, you are often more like a river-rafting guide who\'s been paid a bonus to purposely steer your clients into the roughest possible water.", Experience
"Certainly I\'ve had the experience of thinking a person was one thing, and finding out they were another.", Experience
"I think we\'re the only jokeless show on television. I mean really, we have no setups and no punch lines. It\'s not a joke show. There are funny lines and funny moments but again the comedy is born of the human experience and awkward pauses are a great part of what it is to be human.", Experience
"In life there are no problems, that is, objective and external choices; there is only the life which we do not resolve as a problem but which we live as an experience, whatever the final result may be.", Experience
"While I was trying to save money to go to the National Institute of Dramatic Art in Australia I ended up getting all of this experience which meant that by the time I had enough money in the bank to go to school I didn\'t really need to go to school anymore.", Experience
"Sol has experience, pace and physical power, which nobody else has together.", Experience
"An adolescent is somebody who is in between things. A teenager is somebody who\'s kind of permanently there. And so living with them through the various teenage hopes and sorrows and joys was curiously enough a maturing experience for me.", Experience
"I feel that between my experience and my mother\'s, breast cancer is a little bit like someone who lives next door. I know what that person looks like and what their daily habits are.", Experience
"I have been blessed in many ways, and one of those is to have been born in Africa, for me a great treasure house of stories. I have been researching it since my infancy; reading about it, talking to men and women who have spent their lives in this land, living it as I have and loving it as I do. I write almost entirely from my own experience.", Experience
"Writing \'Book 1: The Maze of Bones\' didn\'t feel much different than writing one of my other novels, but I thought it was very innovative to offer the website and trading card components as well for those readers who wanted to go more in depth with the Cahill experience.", Experience
"When I write, I\'m still imagining a kid reading it on paper. I read e-books when I travel, but in general I still prefer holding an old-fashioned book in my hands. There\'s a special, tactile experience.", Experience
"Scientific understanding is often beautiful, a profoundly aesthetic experience which gives pleasure not unlike the reading of a great poem.", Experience
"The most experience I had in the criminology field is playing a thug as an actor. That was my first paid job. The police academy at the college was paying people to reenact the calls that potential cops would get. So I got to play thugs and people who were unruly.", Experience
"If you search and search and stop searching, then ultimately you\'ll find what you need. It is the experience of living.", Experience
"Acting is a very personal process. It has to do with expressing your own personality, and discovering the character you\'re playing through your own experience - so we\'re all different.", Experience
"I\'m a culture vulture, and I just want to experience it all.", Experience
"If people choose to live their life in a way that does not confront the more troubling aspects of their experience, that\'s fine, if it works for them. But it will probably make them uncomfortable if they come up against somebody like me. So they just shouldn\'t! They shouldn\'t read my work!", Experience
"If there\'s any object in human experience that\'s a precedent for what a computer should be like, it\'s a musical instrument: a device where you can explore a huge range of possibilities through an interface that connects your mind and your body, allowing you to be emotionally authentic and expressive.", Experience
"And I thought, when I have kids, that\'s the sort of well told, silly, and fun fairy tale that I would want to take them to. But it was an amazing experience. And I think Shrek is a real classic, a fairy tale classic.", Experience
"Beliefs have the power to create and the power to destroy. Human beings have the awesome ability to take any experience of their lives and create a meaning that disempowers them or one that can literally save their lives.", Experience
"Experience keeps a dear school, but fools will learn in no other.", Experience
"Fame will go by and, so long, I\'ve had you, fame. If it goes by, I\'ve always known it was fickle. So at least it\'s something I experience, but that\'s not where I live.", Experience
"I probably hold the distinction of being one movie star who, by all laws of logic, should never have made it. At each stage of my career, I lacked the experience.", Experience
"Experience, as a desire for experience, does not come off. We must not study ourselves while having an experience.", Experience
"There are three methods to gaining wisdom. The first is reflection, which is the highest. The second is limitation, which is the easiest. The third is experience, which is the bitterest.", Experience
"Sex without love is a meaningless experience, but as far as meaningless experiences go its pretty damn good.", Experience
"We should not look back unless it is to derive useful lessons from past errors, and for the purpose of profiting by dearly bought experience.", Experience
"Wealth is the ability to fully experience life.", Experience
"The wise are instructed by reason, average minds by experience, the stupid by necessity and the brute by instinct.", Experience
"To use the same words is not a sufficient guarantee of understanding; one must use the same words for the same genus of inward experience; ultimately one must have one\'s experiences in common.", Experience
"We learn from experience that men never learn anything from experience.", Experience
"I don\'t have to have faith, I have experience.", Experience
"Men are wise in proportion, not to their experience, but to their capacity for experience.", Experience
"Is there anyone so wise as to learn by the experience of others?", Experience
"Once we believe in ourselves, we can risk curiosity, wonder, spontaneous delight, or any experience that reveals the human spirit.", Experience
"What each must seek in his life never was on land or sea. It is something out of his own unique potentiality for experience, something that never has been and never could have been experienced by anyone else.", Experience

"I\'m really proud of \'Moneyball.\' To me, it\'s about feeling pride in a movie I made. I think when I\'m an old man I\'ll be able to show it to my grandkids with pride. That\'s all I can really go for: making movies to please me.", Movies

"Too much TV hurts movies.", Movies
"Movies always are open to being remade because times change so much, and the tempo of movies changes. I think of it like a James Bond. They can have different actors play the same role...

"So, one way or another, I found myself in a few movies. I take it seriously when I\'m on the set, but I don\'t take myself seriously as an actor.", Movies
"Minimalism seems closest to the sophisticated storytelling of movies. Movies have really educated contemporary audiences to be the most intelligent, sophisticated audiences in history.

"Becoming emancipated at 14, my life wasn\'t normal. I didn\'t have to go to school, so I didn\'t. I was rebellious by nature.

I\'m crazy about photography, and I want to take an art history class.", Movies
"I can be in 20 movies. But I\'ll never be an actor.", Movies

"The first two movies I directed failed, when I was 21 and 23, and that was the greatest thing that could have happened.", Movies

"Back in the \'70s, like one of my favorite movies ever was \'The Bad News Bears\', and that was a kids\' movie, but I don\'t think of it that way. I think of it as just a great movie because Walter Matthau was so funny and so harsh with those kids.", Movies

"But what I really like are old Hollywood movies. Very often I watch AMC.", Movies
"I loved all those classic figures from the \'30s and \'40s... Bette Davis, Joan Crawford, Humphrey Bogart, Rita Hayworth. They had such glamour and style. I loved the movies of those times too - so much attention paid to details, lights, clothing, the way the studios would develop talent.", Movies

"It\'s time for me to do things I like so I will be happy, my wife will be happy, my friends will be happy. I just want to do something I\'m proud of. It\'s time for me to change. I could sign with a company for 10 movies and I\'m the king of video and so what?", Movies

"All my friends were in college when I was making \'Superbad.\' We were drinking beer and watching movies and eating pizza. It wasn\'t like I was going to nice restaurants or anything like that, and I lived like a frat guy. Eventually it was time to grow up, be healthy and be responsible. You can\'t live like a kid forever, you know?", Movies
"I think our culture has gotten so skewed. People assume that because you\'re an actor you want to write a book to exploit your celebrity, but my celebrity is only a byproduct of me making movies. I have no intention of being a celebrity.", Movies
"I never go overbudget on my movies.", Movies
"If you\'re not a real chameleon of an actor and if you\'re not one of those guys who can really shape-change themselves all the time, one of the ways to keep pushing yourself and keep changing is to be in different kinds of movies.", Movies

"Our brand at Netflix is really focused on movies and TV shows.", Movies
"Luis Bunuel made great movies.", Movies
"I often begin movies with music in my head; it\'s a very important dimension to me. Not just the music itself, but how to use music in film: when and how and subtlety. I don\'t like to be too sweet in my stories, and I like the abrasive clang, the contrasting of sounds and cultures.", Movies
"In America, we have so many movies and so much media about the Islamic world, the sub-continental world, but it\'s not a conversation, it\'s a monologue. It\'s always from one point of view. \'If we don\'t tell our own stories, no one will tell them\' is my mantra.", Movies

"I\'ve seen little pieces of \'Interview with a Vampire\' when it was on TV, but I kind of always go yuck! I don\'t watch R-rated movies, so that really cuts down on a lot of the horror.", Movies
"We were raised without movies, theater or music. We had only nature, the hills, the trees. When I got on the set of \'Manon,\' I wasn\'t star-struck because I didn\'t know what a star was.", Movies
"Even a happy life cannot be without a measure of darkness, and the word happy would lose its meaning if it were not balanced by sadness. It is far better take things as they come along with patience and equanimity.", Patience

"I can\'t remember a major league game where I could make eye contact with my dad. I kept wondering if he was going to yell at me for hanging a pitch or something.", Dad
"My life isn\'t that dramatic. My dad really loves me, he just can\'t talk on the phone. He\'s too crippled and shy, and that\'s almost harder. He\'s there and he loves me, and I try and try and try, it\'s just impossible to have a relationship.", Dad
"I\'m an ambassador for the Make-A-Wish Foundation, and one of the children, his wish was to go to the Emmys, so he\'s going to be my date, along with my husband, and my dad and his girlfriend.

"I want to make him the proudest dad to have me and I want to show everybody and nearly be as good as him because he was the best.", Dad
"Going through the grief period of my dad and losing him - that was the worst thing because you know when you get that call. When you are seven, eight years old, you have that almost vision in your mind of what that\'s going to be like and what your going to feel like and it doesn\'t prepare you.", Dad

"The best thing I ever learned from my dad was he knew he wasn\'t the best of singers, but he always knew he was a great entertainer, and I always thought that was a good concept to bring along, that ultimately acting is an entertainment art and you have to be aware of the fact that you want people to be excited to be watching you.", Dad
"My dad\'s era believed that there was something noble in being a good guy - the kind of guy that lived straight and narrow, told the truth, and stood up for what he believed was right.", Dad

"My dad served in the Air Force as ground crew for several years, and doesn\'t really talk about it. I know that it\'s there. I think my main thing about direct or indirect experiences as near to home as it were is the idea of self-sacrifice really.", Dad
"As it has been told to me, my Dad had some kind of deal with Dick Clark. But when we got here, that fell through. So we were out here with no job, no furniture, no food.", Dad
"When I was a kid, I wanted to walk with my dad\'s limp - my dad was my hero - but that infuriated him, and he would make me walk back and forth in the living room until I walked without it.", Dad
"My dad has always been very proud of me but I think I have exceeded his expectations. When I told him I wanted to be an actor and moved to New York City, I think he assumed I would be playing the guitar on the subway and collecting spare change in my guitar case. The fact that I\'m not doing that means that I\'m a huge success.", Dad
"My dad never told me that when you audition, you might not get the role. He wanted to wait until my first disappointment to tell me.", Dad

"Truthfully, I\'m still Corey Hart, Dad, first.", Dad
"My dad keeps joking about sneaking into my grandparents\' house and switching out their HBO for PBS so they think I\'m on \'Downton Abbey.\'", Dad
"My dad is Greek and my mum Jamaican. My grandparents brought me up for most of my childhood, but I saw my mum and dad all the time.", Dad
"I look at my little girl and I wonder what she\'s going to be and what she\'s going to do and what is it that leads girls certain directions in life. I think a lot of that goes back to what kind of father they had, and so it makes me want to be the best dad I can possibly be.", Dad
"I had always loved music. I grew up listening to classic country, Waylon Jennings, Merle Haggard. My dad loved Vern Gosdin and Keith Whitley. So I kept going to class and started getting totally into playing guitar and teaching myself these songs.", Dad
"Dad worked his entire career as an aviation technician. Mom was a legal secretary who became a teacher. We lived a simple American life.", Dad
"It\'s always been a dream of mine to get somewhere and to have my mom and dad with me up there.", Dad

"My mum\'s parents were from Ireland, my dad\'s mum was American-Irish.", Dad
"My Dad died during the flu epidemic in 1918 when I was 4 years old. He left a lot of classical recordings behind that I began listening to at an early age, so he must have been a music lover.", Dad
"It\'s something he used to say when he was happy. It could be a very, very simple day. We might be sitting out on the front lawn. Dad loved classical music and we might be listening to some Stravinsky or something and having some tea and eggs. And he\'d say, \'Oh, good stuff, isn\'t it?\'", Dad
"Dad has, and had, a deservedly glowing reputation. However, this belief in \'reputation first\' seems to have given rise to his fears of what might be rumored after his death.", Dad
"The grief of losing my father has come in waves over the years, as it does with most people. His love and devotion as a father provided my closest, most intimate relationship. Dad, and our time together, is in my bones. While reflecting on him, the memories themselves seem to boil down into certain \'essences of Dad.\'", Dad
"When I knew I was pregnant four years ago with a boy, a friend suggested I call him Cary, but I initially resisted. There was only one Cary Grant. But a week before he was due, I started thinking it would be wonderful to pass the name on to him. And anyway, my father wasn\'t Cary to me. He was Dad.", Dad
"One of the myths about Dad was that he was mean. That simply wasn\'t true. I always found him generous to a fault but he wasn\'t reckless with his money, which was rather rare in Hollywood. He\'d grown up with nothing and he wasn\'t about to fritter it all away.", Dad
"The best word to describe my father? Thoughtful. There was a tender quality to Dad that his sense of fun could sometimes mask. But, above all, he was sensitive and looked out for those he loved.", Dad
"Can\'t blame men for wanting him. And wouldn\'t be surprised if Dad even mildly flirted back. Dad somewhat enjoyed being called gay. He said it made women want to prove the assertion wrong.", Dad
"I\'m sure there was some part of his soul was intrinsically happy, but he probably had to go through some permutations to really get that to blossom. I\'m sure Dad had his challenges, but I think that joy was there from the beginning and he had to find a way to make his life support that and express that.", Dad
"When I was a kid, I used to imagine animals running under my bed. I told my dad, and he solved the problem quickly. He cut the legs off the bed.", Dad
"Being a father to my family and a husband is to me much more important than what I did in the business.", Dad
"My dad always said, \'Don\'t worry what people think, because you can\'t change it.\'", Dad
"Rich men\'s sons are seldom rich men\'s fathers.", Dad
"No man is responsible for his father. That was entirely his mother\'s affair.", Dad
"Dad, wherever you are, you are gone but you will never be forgotten.", Dad
"Dad almost died of a heart attack in the middle of making Apocalypse Now, the biggest movie of his life. It doesn\'t make you want to jump into that business.", Dad
"What is a normal childhood? We weren\'t rich, we were pretty middle-class. My dad survived from job to job; with him taking care of so many relatives, he couldn\'t save any money.", Dad
"I was built up from my dad more than anyone else.", Dad
"My dad had a church of 90 people when I was born. It was just, over the years it continued to grow.", Dad
"I didn\'t try to copy my dad or fit into the pressure or the mold that everybody tried to make me fit into.", Dad

"My dad said to me growing up: \'When all is said and done, if you can count all your true friends on one hand, you\'re a lucky man.\'", Dad
"My mom and dad gave their kids the greatest gift of all - the gift of unconditional love. They cared deeply about who we would be, and much less about what we would do.", Dad
"I\'ve got high standards when it comes to boys. As my dad says, all girls should! I\'m from the South - Tennessee, to be exact - and down there, we\'re all about southern hospitality. I know that if I like a guy, he better be nice, and above all, my dad has to approve of him!", Dad
"Anyone can be a father, but it takes someone special to be a dad, and that\'s why I call you dad, because you are so special to me. You taught me the game and you taught me how to play it right.", Dad
"When it comes to Father\'s Day, I will remember my dad for both being there to nurture me and also for the times he gave me on my own to cultivate my own interests and to nurture my own spirit.", Dad
"I remember going on carriage rides with Dad when we\'d visit. I think quiet L.A. suited him better, but he loved to see shows here, he loved to visit his friends in the Hamptons.", Dad
"Simple. Pared down. Timeless. The ties were never too thick or too thin; the pants were never too flared or too skinny. In my life with Dad, he wore Western apparel because we went riding - jeans, cowboy boots, the turquoise belt buckle. But it was all very simple, and that classic look is very \'Ralph Lauren.\'", Dad
"I\'ve got an idea for a modern day faerie tale that I think would made a great short novel. But I just don\'t have the time to work on it right now. I\'m way too busy with the \'Kingkiller Chronicles\' and being a new dad.", Dad
"My mother\'s incredibly giving, almost too giving at times. And, my dad is a real logical person. He\'s got logic for every situation. They\'ve been married for 24 years, so there was that stability, also. I really learned to think on my own at a very young age.", Dad
"I love playing a dad. It\'s hard to find family dramas that are genuinely funny.", Dad
"That\'s a tough question; I\'ve been acting since I was 10. My dad was an entrepreneur, so I guess something along those lines. I wouldn\'t want a 9-5 job.", Dad
"My dad was the baby. When he was born they were already successful. They sent him to business school - he probably would have loved to have been a poet or a writer or something, and he was very creative.", Dad
"More of him came from my step-dad, who is now passed away. The initial creators of the show kind of based the character on their dads and then I added my dad.", Dad
"My dad was born in Chicago in 1908... his parents came from Russia. They settled in Chicago, where they lived in a little tiny grocery store with eight or nine children - in the backroom all together - and my grandmother got the idea to go into the movie business.", Dad
"My dad\'s an architect and my mom owned a French bakery for twelve years.", Dad
"When I realized I was having trouble reading, I was too embarrassed to ask for help. Some teachers believed in me, but I just wasn\'t focused on school - I was into the music and trying to please my dad.", Dad
"My background is basically scientific math. My Dad was a physicist, so I have it in my blood somewhere. Scientific method is very important to me. I think anything that contradicts it is probably not true.", Dad
"My father was Catholic, my mother was Protestant, and because of that I got Christened in both churches, so I\'ve got all these names... but my Dad always called me Mick.", Dad
"My mom was a dancer, my dad\'s a singer and I\'ve always had that kind of music in my life.", Dad
"My dad always said I was hard-headed, that it would take something like that to wake me up spiritually, and I guess it did. My heart had gotten so beat up that I didn\'t have anything left to give.", Dad
"It was sort of just a family sport. My mom and dad were pretty keen golfers when I was young and so were my grandparents, and I just sort of tagged along with them.", Dad
"But although Australia was also involved in the Vietnam conflict, I can remember my dad telling us that if we were in Australia, we wouldn\'t be drafted until we were 20.", Dad
"But my father was also the one who told me I needed to clean up my mouth or I\'d never find a man. What\'s very important to him is manners. Show up on time. Always send thank-you letters. He is one of the more thoughtful humans I\'ve ever met. He\'s a great man and a very good dad.", Dad
"I\'ve always had an affinity for lawyers. My dad is a lawyer. He\'s retired now. My brother is a lawyer.", Dad
"He was a manager, one of the singers, I guess talent coordinator for the local talent in Harlem. His name was Lover Patterson. He was living right across the street from where my dad had his restaurant. I guess he saw a lot of kids come in, a lot of my buddies.", Dad
"I wasn\'t sure how my dad would react. There was an agent sitting behind them and he told me he was embarrassed to watch the scenes. My parents have always been very open. They trust my decisions.", Dad
"I\'m afraid that this is me getting on my high horse now but we have yob television, yob newspapers, and funny enough whereas it was my mum and dad, school, police, church who used to set the standards, now it\'s tabloids and yob television who set the standards by which people live.", Dad

"I think I meant that, given the circumstances of my childhood, I had the illusion that it\'s easier to be alone.

"Something like \'Without a Paddle\' does really well at the box office and I\'m like, \'Oh, here we go.\' In \'Without a Paddle\' I\'m the romantic lead - great!

"Building a little bonfire at night on the beach and lying on a blanket with my wife under the stars is not only sexy, it\'s romantic.", Romantic

"I think in a lot of romantic comedies it ends with a kiss, and I feel like in modern day relationships, and maybe just my own experience, it starts with a kiss and then all sort of falls apart and then comes together. You\'re texting. You\'re wondering what\'s going on. There\'s no definitions, there\'s no labels.", Romantic

"I hate to sound like a romantic adolescent, but I believe artists don\'t generally see art as a career choice; they simply can\'t overcome their desire to make art, and will live on little income for as long as they have to, before they start to sell their work - or give up and get a paying job.", Romantic

"I am a hopeless romantic. And I won\'t stop till I get it right.", Romantic
"As far as the lack of hits goes, I think perhaps it\'s because I\'ve played a lot of different roles and have not created a persona that the public can latch on to. I have played everything from psychopathic killers to romantic leading men, and in picking such diverse roles I have avoided typecasting.", Romantic

"I think in general, romantic comedies tend to take one person\'s point of view, but every once in a while you get something that is balanced for two people.", Romantic

We don\'t buy junk food and give them options of fresh fruit, yogurt, raw almonds, or dried whole grain cereals for snack time.", Age
"As a father, I believe that involving children in sports at a young age is generally, a wise proposition.

"I like the way Quentin Tarantino creates a scene using a series of close-ups or showing very cool images of a person or people walking on some ordinary street in slow motion. I wish I could achieve that kind of slow-motion effect in manga, but it\'s rather difficult to draw; the only things we can play with are tones of black and white.", Cool
"I\'m in a comic book now. That was cool. That\'s something that I\'m still sorta reeling about, \'cause I read comics as a kid. Someone drew me, and actually did a pretty good job!", Cool
"Film and television are just different. Film is cool because it\'s a complete package. You know the beginning, middle, and end. You can plan it out more, which I like. But with television you get a new script every week, so it\'s constantly a mystery as to what you\'re going to be doing.", Cool
"Placebo is music for outsiders, by outsiders and our gigs are like conventions of outcasts, which is cool.", Cool

"What people don\'t understand is joining a gang ain\'t bad, it\'s cool, it\'s fine. When you in the hood, joining a gang it\'s cool because all your friends are in the gang, all your family\'s in the gang. We\'re not just killing people every night, we\'re just hanging out, having a good time.", Cool
"I\'m doing everything that I can, working with experts, really studying the statistics to figure out a way we can make it cool or normal to be kind and loving.", Cool
"Cricket makes no sense to me. I find it beautiful to watch and I like that they break for tea. That is very cool, but I don\'t understand. My friends from The Clash tried to explain it years and years ago, but I didn\'t understand what they were talking about.", Cool
"Where I come from it was really unheard of to be at a party and someone says, \'What kind of music do you make?\', and you say, \'Pop music.\' You may as well have \'I\'m not cool\' stamped on your forehead.", Cool
"Playing well with others is important - not being too flashy, just keeping good time and of course coming up with cool beats. A good snare drum, kick drum, high hat. Just getting good at the hand feet coordination.", Cool
"Remember the first time you went to a show and saw your favorite band. You wore their shirt, and sang every word. You didn\'t know anything about scene politics, haircuts, or what was cool. All you knew was that this music made you feel different from anyone you shared a locker with. Someone finally understood you. This is what music is about.", Cool
"I know that people think I\'m sexy and I am looked at as that. It is cool with me. It\'s wonderful to have sexy appeal. If you embrace it, it can be a very beautiful thing.", Cool
"If you want to go to the mall, you have to take security. But it\'s always cool. The kids are amazing.", Cool
"Racism is taught in the home. We agree on that? Well, it\'s very hard to teach racism to a teenager who\'s listening to rap music and who idolizes, say, Snoop Dogg. It\'s hard to say, \'That guy is less than you.\' The kid is like, \'I like that guy, he\'s cool. How is he less than me?", Cool
"Someone who doesn\'t take herself too seriously and can be a goofball. Because everyone\'s a nerd inside, I don\'t care how cool you are.", Cool

"It\'s cool now to play golf.", Cool
"At first I was queasy; I\'ll never forget the sound of the scalpel cutting a body open. But it was so cool trying to work out how these people died.", Cool
"I remember being on film sets when I was younger, and only men got to do the cool action movies. So I thought, \'Maybe I\'ll get to produce one day and get to do cool stuff too,\' which is what happened when we did \'Charlie\'s Angels.\' Starting my production company was a big turning point for me.", Cool
"Summer is a great time to visit art museums, which offer the refreshing rinse of swimming pools - only instead of cool water, you immerse yourself in art.", Cool
"That\'s one of the cool things about fame. You have an affect on society and where it goes.", Cool
"I have a cycle that is not particularly cool, but it\'s a cycle: trash myself to reward myself.", Cool
"I grew up not really having anything, so the idea that I can take care of my family and my friends now is a really cool bonus.", Cool
"Sure, climbing Mount Everest would be cool, but that\'s something I would now like to do as a family. Big experiences like that I don\'t want to have on my own anymore. I want to share them.", Cool

"It\'s cool to have a well run, comfortable and inviting home.", Cool
"Be still and cool in thine own mind and spirit.", Cool
"Is a hippopotamus a hippopotamus, or just a really cool Opotamus?", Cool
"I\'m a mirror. If you\'re cool with me, I\'m cool with you, and the exchange starts. What you see is what you reflect. If you don\'t like what you see, then you\'ve done something. If I\'m standoffish, that\'s because you are.", Cool
"I\'m a Muslim, but I think Jesus would have a drink with me. He would be cool. He would talk to me.", Cool

"Keep a cool head and maintain a low profile. Never take the lead - but aim to do something big.", Cool
"I don\'t mind The Boss. I think he\'s an honest guy. I have some of his records, not all of them. I\'ve met a couple of the E-Street guys, and they seem really cool.", Cool
"I\'m someone who loves to enjoy life and tries to focus on real things and real friendships. That\'s why I live very simply. I\'m a jeans and T-shirt kind of girl. I don\'t spend much time fixing myself up or trying to look cool. I live like a normal person and even though I\'m in a very high-profile business, I really don\'t let it affect the way I live.", Cool
"If your stomach disputes you, lie down and pacify it with cool thoughts.", Cool

"I\'m cool with failing so long as I know that there are people around me that love me unconditionally.", Cool
"I\'m cute - and God I hate that. Because that\'s not cool. I\'m like your niece, and nobody wants to date their niece. It\'s the chubby cheeks. The whole reason people voted for me on American Idol is because I\'m an everyday, normal girl.", Cool
"It\'s cool just because I\'ve had this dream of changing the sport of swimming and it\'s finally happening.", Cool

"I have to admit that \'Psychology Today\' was one of the first magazines I started reading, back when I was 13 or 14, because I was the kind of kid that was curious about the mysterious human mind - I hoped to learn about telekenisis, multiple personalities, psychosis, and various other cool and terrible things that happened inside people\'s heads.", Cool
"It\'s cool when people know you more, but I like people to treat me regular when they see me. I take pictures. I don\'t really be big on people looking at me.", Cool
"Maybe you are the \'cool\' generation If coolness means a capacity to stay calm and use your head in the service of ends passionately believed in, then it has my admiration.", Cool
"I am kind of a private person, so I don\'t miss that part of show business at all. Looking back on my career in television and making a movie like \'The Sound of Music\' from an adult point of view, it actually seems kind of unreal. I was involved in shows that people grew up with - that hold memories for them - and it\'s a cool feeling.", Cool
"I\'m a big fan of all the Boston guys that are acting - Matt Damon , Ben Affleck, Mark Wahlberg - they made a great career out of it, and they found a way to do it and still be cool guys, so that\'s kind of where I want to be.", Cool
"I was a dancer, and it\'s not really cool for a boy to dance, so it was inspiring to see a movie like \'Footloose\' where a guy is dancing masculine and had a proper reason behind it. It made me feel cool, and when these kids would make fun of me, I\'d be like, \'Oh, didn\'t you see \'Footloose,\' man?\'", Cool
"I think the really cool and compelling thing about math and physics is that it opens up entry to all these hypotheticals - or at least, it gives you the language to talk about them. But at the same time, if a scenario is completely disconnected from reality, it\'s not all that interesting.", Cool
"I used to do this as a kid. And now they\'re paying me for it, which is cool.", Cool
"I love \'Goodfellas\' because it\'s a great movie - it\'s funny and there is action at perfect points. I just think Martin Scorsese makes everyone look really cool.", Cool
"There aren\'t many things that are universally cool, and it\'s cool not to litter. I\'d never do it.", Cool
"I\'m cool with where I\'m at. It\'s certain things I wanna do to be better, but I\'m good.", Cool
"White people couldn\'t do black music back in the day because they weren\'t funky or bad enough. They weren\'t from the ghettoes, but hip-hop and R&B changed all of that because white kids want to be down with it. They wanted to learn it so they studied the culture. It\'s kind of a cool thing because we shouldn\'t be so separate.", Cool
"\'The Watch\' is first and foremost a comedy, but since I got to shoot the film using elements from the sci-fi genre, I wanted to make sure the alien didn\'t look goofy. I got to make a real alien that looks dangerous. That was a big plus for me because I got to do something really fun and cool.", Cool
"When you come to L.A. as a kid with your mom, you\'re lured into doing things that you think are cool and fun and a good idea, but they\'re cheesy and awful. And recording a pop single was one of them.", Cool
"Being in L.A., it was really hard to find a country writer and producer. I eventually - years of searching - found this guy, Dan Franklin. He\'s an incredible musician and producer. We write so well together... It\'s been a really cool experience.", Cool
"I know some actors feel classes are not cool or they create negative public relations, but I continue to crave the story just beyond my reach. To grasp that brass ring I need to continue to fine-tune my talents.", Cool
"There\'s nothing less funny than someone who looks cool. There\'s nothing more unappealing.", Cool
"Anthony Davis is cool.", Cool
"I\'ve done four other films since \'Submarine,\' so that\'s quite cool. It\'s just good to have people respect your work; I\'ve never had that before. Yeah, my life has changed crazy. I\'m a kid from a small town in south Wales, I play my Xbox usually and all that sort of stuff, and it\'s a whole new world.", Cool
"The \'Being Human\' people were really cool and let me improvise. They had such a good working atmosphere. It was a cool set-up and a really good environment to be in.", Cool
"I\'m getting a lot of stick because my character in \'Young Dracula\' wanted to be vampire, so now that I am a vampire, everyone\'s like, \'You finally did it!\' But it\'s cool and I loved doing \'Young Dracula.\' That show\'s finished and I don\'t know why it ended, so it was brilliant to go into \'Being Human,\' which is like the adult version of it.", Cool
"I\'d love to pop back into \'Being Human\' as Adam. I love the character so much. I\'ve never really played a character like that. I\'m always playing the geek, so to play a kid who is very energetic when he wants to be, and who is always trying to get the girls, was really cool.", Cool
"I noticed that this defense attorney is a very, very intelligent man, and he\'s very cool and he\'s very knowledgeable, and I think that personally I\'d like to have an attorney like him.", Cool
"It\'s now possible to play and take lessons from any place of the world. The concept of physical distance doesn\'t exist in the online world, and that is so cool!", Cool
"I liked the way my character, Shane, was first introduced. You get introduced to her through this sexual action, and I thought that was so cool and just kind of summed up what she enjoys and who she is, to a certain extent. She\'s a complete sexual being and the great thing is that she doesn\'t apologize for it. It\'s just who she is. We rarely see women be able to do that on television.", Cool
"I\'m not as cool as I\'m supposed to be.", Cool
"Yeah, me and Q-Tip is cool outside of the business, but you know, within the business sometimes it can get ugly, you know what I mean?", Cool
"The alternative scene, for a couple years now, has been taken seriously and that\'s a cool thing. I don\'t think it\'s exploded or anything, but I think it\'s pretty cool that it still exists, it\'s still affecting people.", Cool
"I\'m not cool with ACORN or the working families\' party, or people that vote like democrats and run on Republican lines.", Cool
"I\'m playing with Bonnie Raitt. I don\'t have to sing it. I just have to play it. That\'s cool.", Cool
"I have this desire to just while away weeks, months and years. It took me two years to make this record but that was with me trying to condense my process and not disappear down the rabbit hole with all the cool things I\'ve collected. I could take 10 years and not explore everything I want to with these instruments.", Cool
"I started off dancing and playing sports, and I joined the drama stuff, the theatre stuff in middle school because my friends were involved, and it was kind of the cool thing to do.", Cool
"I used to listen to \'Perfect Day\' by Hoku every single day in high school! \'On this perfect day, nothin\' standin\' in my way... Don\'t you try to rain on my perfect day.\' It pumped me up when I was feeling down or defeated, whether it was from the cool kids making me feel left out or feeling overwhelmed with homework and mean teachers.", Cool
"It\'s cool to be in the paper every once in awhile and people read about you and they know who you are.", Cool
"We live in a world that tells us not to care, to consume everything in sight. It tells us that being cool and being an individual actually means buying what everyone else is buying and doing what everyone else is doing.", Cool
"When I was in high school, my friends and I would drive out into the country to abandoned houses and structures... haha... to ghost hunt. We would scare each other so bad! We would sometimes camp out by the abandoned buildings just to scare ourselves! Such good times. The adrenaline of real fear is so cool!", Cool
"I\'ve never won an award for anything, and I think it\'s weird. I mean, that\'s really cool but it\'s strange to think you could get an award for acting. I always thought that was strange.", Cool
"It\'s really cool to know that you\'ve put something together that isn\'t for a particular audience. It\'s so often that a TV show can really only speak to one sect of the population, and this really is something that appeals to a worldwide fan base. People who are into the pursuit of knowledge. Their reaction has meant the world to us.", Cool
"I think there are four or five interesting pockets where a lot of cool technology companies are getting started. Chicago is one of them. New York is certainly another. Silicon Valley really dominates. And you\'re seeing some stuff out of Boston and Seattle and down South.", Cool
"And getting stunt coordinator Dan Bradley and everybody from the whole \'Bourne Supremacy\' crew, I think was real cool for our film because we do a bunch of really big jumps in this movie.", Cool
"I just thought it could make a really cool movie. It\'s not that it\'s just a buddy comedy but it\'s all about two guys hating each other and towards the end they\'re good friends. I liked that these two guys were best friends from the very beginning, and they\'re crazy.", Cool
"You can think of Hollywood as high school. TV actors are freshmen, comedy actors are maybe juniors, and dramatic actors - they\'re the cool seniors.", Cool
"The cool thing about my profession is that I can do it until the day I die.", Cool
"A couple days ago, I saw a lot of people tweeting, \'Oh, it\'s so cool \'Home\' is being used in the Olympics!\' We don\'t really get to watch much TV, man, with the concerts every night, but I wish I could have seen it. I really just found out through Twitter and my management texting me. I thought it was really awesome.", Cool
"But Freedom Strike was actually quite cool.", Cool
"It\'s really cool to see glowsticks at the show, to see dance music culture infiltrating and becoming one with the metal community.", Cool
"I think sometimes I guess you see records, say you want to get there and use that as motivation. In a way, it\'s kind of cool if there is a possibility to rewrite history and be up there with the greats of Olympic history.", Cool
"I\'ve been in fights, but that doesn\'t make me cool or like a tough guy or more interesting actor, I\'m not proud of it.", Cool

"I\'m going to let people know that it\'s cool to have a child and be young and still be a good mom. It\'s really tough, but I\'m doing it.", Cool
"I just hope that theaters remain. I think there\'s something very wonderful about getting into a dark room with a bunch of people. There\'s something cool about that. Brings us all together in one room where we can experience all those emotions.", Cool
"I think it\'s so cool to be tall. Even when I\'m not wearing heels people tell me I\'m tall and I always take it as a complement. The good thing is I can always see everybody in the room.", Cool
"The cool kindliness of sheets, that soon smooth away trouble; and the rough male kiss of blankets.", Cool
"My friends are people who like building cool stuff. We always have this joke about people who want to just start companies without making something valuable. There\'s a lot of that in Silicon Valley.", Cool
"I used to be a cool chick but I\'m not anymore.", Cool
"They\'re very, uh, you know, I don\'t come from the suburbs and a jolly, Disney type of lifestyle. I come from something totally different. And they\'re cool and bare minimum so it\'s not always a money issue for me.", Cool

"An orange on the table, your dress on the rug, and you in my bed, sweet present of the present, cool of night, warmth of my life.", Cool
"Again, like I said, we\'re not trying to censor anyone. If you think drugs are cool, fine. Make that movie. We are not going to stop you, or try to stop you, but we would encourage other people to be a bit more responsible about their portrayal of drug usage.", Cool
"The cool thing about working and meeting a lot of people through your acting is that you never know who you might work with, in the future.", Cool
"Now that I finally have the time for it, this web surfing stuff turns out to be as interesting and fun and addictive as you\'ve all been telling me. Zipping from link to link, chasing an idea across the noosphere, sucking up information like a killer whale - way cool.", Cool
"I don\'t have time to worry about looking cool.", Cool
"Now that we are cool, he said, and regret that we hurt each other, I am not sorry that it happened.", Cool
"I once saw a picture in the paper of John Hegley with \'poet\' written on his knuckles, and I thought that was pretty cool, so I was quite up front about it.", Cool
"I get to hang out with people I think are awesome, and do work I think is awesome. It\'s really cool.", Cool
"It\'s cool to have critical success because it\'s always nice for your peers to say, \'Good job.\' But who cares about them?", Cool
"I have very fond memories of growing up in Greece, of my brothers and I causing chaos and climbing up trees, which is really cool. Back then, we didn\'t have all the video games and all that stuff. We just had each other, and we played on the street.", Cool
"In the old days, a TV sync was perceived as not so cool or whittling away at your indie cred. Now it\'s seen as much more of an opportunity than a sellout, as a way to find fans who wouldn\'t have ordinarily come across their genre of music.", Cool
"All you \'Twilight\' fans, can\'t thank you really enough for being so supportive. You\'re real cool people.", Cool

"I don\'t view Twitter as a promotional tool but as a really, really, really cool cocktail party.", Cool
"I think the radio is kind of cool, because you\'re really free to do whatever you want, because you can go into another world. Whereas in TV, you have to make that world.", Cool
"Definitely River Phoenix is somebody that I thought, \'This guy is very cool.\' I wanted to be like him when I was a kid.", Cool
"L.A.\'s cool; I had a run with it to where it just pretty much wore me out. I love the weather and I have great friends there, great family, but I really cannot take a lot of the culture. Like Nashville, where everybody\'s a songwriter, everybody out there is an actor.", Cool
"I feel like my music is just an extension of my acting. I treat the songs like scenes that tell a story... it\'s very similar. My favorite thing is when cartoon fans show up to my live gigs! They are always the most kick-butt audience members \'cause they\'re not trying to act all cool like a lot of the music fans do! It\'s refreshing!!", Cool
"My favorite thing is when cartoon fans show up to my live gigs! They are always the most kick-butt audience members \'cause they\'re not trying to act all cool like a lot of the music fans do!", Cool
"I thought that \'Twilight\' would be a kind of girl movie, but it was cool.", Cool
"In France, we don\'t yet have the craft that American TV does or big studios like Paramount. It was so cool going through those famous gates when you have your own little pass and picture on it. Woo hoo, I\'m going to work!", Cool
"I wasn\'t sure if I wanted to put that out there so blatantly, so that before you listen to me you know that I\'m Asian. But I thought it was sort of cool to embrace the Korean half of me, which I love.", Cool
"They very seldom let me lose my cool. They made me like I was Polly Perfect, which was ridiculous so that when I bump into kids on the street they\'d say \'I wish my Mom were like you.\'", Cool
"Personally, I just got one of these Vonage IP phones. It\'s actually pretty cool. It comes with one of these Cisco ATA routers where you just plug an analog handset in.", Cool
"The natural state of motherhood is unselfishness. When you become a mother, you are no longer the center of your own universe. You relinquish that position to your children.", Mom
"Men are what their mothers made them.", Mom
"My mother said to me, \'If you are a soldier, you will become a general. If you are a monk, you will become the Pope.\' Instead, I was a painter, and became Picasso.", Mom
"Mothers are fonder than fathers of their children because they are more certain they are their own.", Mom
"The mother-child relationship is paradoxical and, in a sense, tragic. It requires the most intense love on the mother\'s side, yet this very love must help the child grow away from the mother, and to become fully independent.", Mom
"That strong mother doesn\'t tell her cub, Son, stay weak so the wolves can get you. She says, Toughen up, this is reality we are living in.", Mom
"Only God Himself fully appreciates the influence of a Christian mother in the molding of character in her children.", Mom
"It is not until you become a mother that your judgment slowly turns to compassion and understanding.", Mom
"I ask people why they have deer heads on their walls. They always say because it\'s such a beautiful animal. There you go. I think my mother is attractive, but I have photographs of her.", Mom

"I\'m a Mommy\'s Girl - the strongest influence in my young life was my mom.", Mom
"When you have a good mother and no father, God kind of sits in. It\'s not enough, but it helps.", Mom
"How simple a thing it seems to me that to know ourselves as we are, we must know our mothers names.", Mom
"Two weeks ago at the U.S. Amateur, my mom caddied, and that is kind of a different feeling, because she\'s your mom and you have to listen to her. It was really comfortable having my mom there, but it\'s also really relieving and comfortable to have someone that knows the course off their hat, really.", Mom
"I\'m from Manchester, Mass., so it was lobster, lobster and more lobster! Also, lots of fish that we caught in the summers, clam chowder and roast beef sandwiches. But my mom was pretty healthy; we had a lot of chicken and broccoli and rice as well.", Mom
"I probably wouldn\'t be singing if not for Michael Jackson. When I started singing, I didn\'t like my tone until my mom put me on to Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder, so listening to the way they used their instrument helped me get more comfortable with my own.", Mom
"My dad also plays a little banjo and guitar, my mom plays the mandolin.", Mom

"My grandmother had six kids - one died as an infant - and she was dirt-poor, and all her kids got an education. And my mom grew up poor. And they both worked so hard and cultivated so much of their own happiness. I wanted to have that like an amulet. Not like armor, but like a magic feather. Like Dumbo\'s magic feather.", Mom

"I think there\'s a time to work, and everyone has to kind of adjust. And then there\'s a time to relax, and be the mom or take the kids on vacation when you need to wind down.

"For me, already being part of a single parent household and knowing it was just me and my mom, you\'d would wake up times and hope that the next day you\'d be able to be alongside your mother because she was out trying to make sure that I was taken care of.

"As a mom, I understand how important it is to ensure kids start their day right and always make sure my kids have a nutritious breakfast.

"Hope is a very thin diet.", Diet
"If you think of exercise as a 60-minute commitment 3 times a week at the gym, you\'re missing the point completely. If you think that going on a diet has something to do with nutrition, you don\'t see the forest through the trees. It is a lifestyle. I know it sounds cliche, but you have to find things you love to do.", Diet
"I tried the paleo diet, which is the caveman diet - lots of meat. And I tried the calorie restriction diet: The idea is that if you eat very, very little - if you\'re on the verge of starvation, you will live a very long time, whether or not you want to, of course.", Diet

I\'m terrible on the weekends about getting up at reasonable hours and all of those things. But, when it comes to my work and the discipline it takes to get to work on time - I hate unprofessionalism.", Diet
"Environmental concern is a little like dieting or paying off credit-card debt - an episodically terrific idea that burns brightly and then seems to fade when we realize there\'s a reason we need to diet or pay down our debt. The reason is that it\'s really, really hard, and too many of us in too many spheres of life choose the easy over the hard.", Diet

"It\'s my firm intention to whop cancer into submission and I truly believe I\'ve given myself the best start possible by radically overhauling my diet and by staying true to my motto, which is: Don\'t worry, be happy, feel good. The first thing I did when I was diagnosed was to turn vegan.", Diet
"I did every diet: Atkins. Cabbage-soup diet. Dean Ornish. But I couldn\'t live the rest of my life like a rabbit.", Diet

"I\'ve never had body issues, I\'ve never had an eating disorder. I\'ve never had to go on a diet and that\'s because of Weight Watchers.", Diet
"I have argued for years that we do not have a health care system in America. We have a disease-management system - one that depends on ruinously expensive drugs and surgeries that treat health conditions after they manifest rather than giving our citizens simple diet, lifestyle and therapeutic tools to keep them healthy.", Diet
"I\'ve tried just about every crazy diet you can imagine.", Diet
"We talk about, you know, diet and that we shouldn\'t give our kids big things and obesity and fast food. Well, you know there are people who don\'t have that problem because they\'re not getting any food! We have so many deep problems and issues facing humanity.", Diet

"Of capital importance is to have a good diet and exercise a lot.", Diet
"I\'ve never followed a vegan or vegetarian diet in the past, but I think I could do it. It would not be easy. I have worked with nutritionists who have said a vegan diet is not necessarily all positive for your health, because you need nutrients you only find in meats. I believe in a balanced diet.", Diet

"A diet that relies heavily on meat production results in higher emissions than a typical vegetarian diet. Different individuals will make different choices. However, the debate about climate change should not be dumbed down to a single slogan, such as \'give up meat to save the planet.\'", Diet
"I know what I have to do if I want to lose weight and stay healthy: eat a proper diet and exercise. All I\'ve got to do is apply it.", Diet

If Brad Pitt gets Kristen Bell, it\'s like, \'Well, of course he did.\' With me, it should be, \'Oh good, a normal-looking guy got her.

"The rich are different. Their wants are very high maintenance. They\'ll pick eye color and hair color, all the way down to what she does for a living, what school she went to. Their list can be extremely long. But at the end of the day, dating is dating, because they\'re human beings.", Dating

"If I\'m with a man, is that going to prevent me from achieving my goal? What sacrifices will I have to make in terms of being myself, if I\'m with a man? Something that young women find out really quickly is that when you start dating, all of a sudden you\'re supposed to have a role. You\'re not allowed to just be yourself.", Dating

"The woman I am currently crazy about was a vegetarian for a year until I started dating her. As is the case with most vegetarians, she had never eaten properly prepared meat, only commercially packaged or otherwise abused flesh.", Dating
"I heard on public radio recently, there\'s a thing called Weed Dating. Singles get together in a garden and weed and then they take turns, they keep matching up with other people.

"I\'m enjoying dating. I\'m single, though, I\'m not in a relationship.", Dating

"If you\'re married, and you have a wife, and you really love your wife, is it good enough to only say to your wife \'I love her\' the day you get married?

"First play I ever did was \'Footloose.\' I played the part of Willard when I was 16. I think I wore my drama teacher\'s jeans and her belt - that\'s how small I was. I know a lot of Willard\'s back story from the musical that\'s not explored in the film. Like he\'s got this whole relationship with his mama, and he sings this song \'Mama Says.\'", Relationship
"My brother and I have too good a relationship to spoil it by working together.", Relationship

"In any solid, good relationship, it takes a while to trust someone.", Relationship
"I personally don\'t believe people really grow. They just learn stuff when they were a kid, and hold on to it, and that affects every relationship they have.", Relationship
"Mandatory auditor rotation is designed to address a potential conflict of interest between a public company and its auditor. Because an auditor is hired and paid by the public company it audits, the auditor\'s desire to maintain a good relationship with its client could conflict with its duty to rigorously question the client\'s financial statements.", Relationship

I would be like, \'But, Daddy, he\'s a musician!\'.", Relationship

"People who supported Obama felt like they formed a relationship, that they were being spoken to. The way that campaign worked and the way he\'s worked during his first term is to make people feel like he\'s grasping their hand, whether it\'s by tweeting or email, moments after an event, sometimes during an event. It makes people relate to him.", Relationship

"One of the things I\'ve started doing lately is tracking my dreams. I feel like there\'s a lot of information there and you can really bring those emotions to the situations that may feel mundane or familiar. That gives them new life and gives you a new relationship with it - if that makes any sort of sense.", Relationship

"When people hold you in high esteem, it\'s very delicate relationship. When they meet you they\'re putting all their chips up. It\'s make or break.", Relationship
"You don\'t repair that relationship by sitting down and talking about trust or making promises. Actually, what rebuilds it is living it and doing things differently - and I think that is what is going to make the difference.", Relationship

"Fathers and mothers have lost the idea that the highest aspiration they might have for their children is for them to be wise... specialized competence and success are all that they can imagine.", Parenting
"It\'s a huge change for your body. You don\'t even want to look in the mirror after you\'ve had a baby, because your stomach is just hanging there like a Shar-Pei.", Parenting
"I don\'t think children\'s inner feelings have changed. They still want a mother and father in the very same house; they want places to play.", Parenting
"Family involvement is a valuable thing and playing together actively can be the \'90s version of it. Instead of just watching, you can do it together... something we don\'t spend enough time on. We can motivate and excite each other about fitness.", Parenting

"If there is any truth to my parenting the dreamwork movement, it comes from the power of the press.", Parenting
"The number of stressors has multiplied exponentially: traffic, money, success, work/life balance, the economy, the environment, parenting, family conflict, relationships, disease. As the nature of human life has become far more complicated, our ancient stress response hasn\'t been able to keep up.", Parenting

"We\'re living in a time when parenting is not at all mirroring the way I was parented. For me, I just followed my parents around on their errands; when they were busy on the phone, I was quiet. It\'s a different kettle of fish these days: They run the house, and you listen to their music, and you go to their appointments.", Parenting
"I hope to find the roles that are age appropriate but not yearning to be younger, or parenting ad nauseam.", Parenting
"My grandmother was a kind of Scarsdale, New York, society woman, best known in her day as the author of the 1959 book \'Growing Your Own Way: An Informal Guide for Teen-Agers\' - this despite being a person whose parenting style made Joan Crawford\'s wire hangers look like pool noodles.", Parenting

"I sort of feel like people are not that honest about their own parenting. Take any teenage household; tell me there is not yelling and conflict.", Parenting
"Don\'t reward bad behavior. It is one of the first rules of parenting. During the financial cataclysm of 2008, we said it differently. When we bailed out banks that had created their own misfortune, we called it a \'moral hazard,\' because the bailout absolved the bank\'s bad acts and created an incentive for it to make the same bad loans again.", Parenting

"I came to parenting the way most of us do - knowing nothing and trying to learn everything.", Parenting
"Happiness is not always through success. Equally, the constant pursuit of success is sure unhappiness. But we have to find the balance. My own thoughts are that parenting is very personal. And we all feel enormous insecurity about parenting. What are they going to think of us 20 years down the line?", Parenting
"I think there are many ways to raise great kids. From what I can tell, Ayelet Waldman\'s kids are interesting, strong, and happy, and if that\'s the case, that\'s good parenting.", Parenting

"You know, parenting is so personal. And we\'re all afraid that we didn\'t quite get it right. And it feels like the stakes are so high. By we - what if we made a mistake?", Parenting
"I do not think there was anything abusive in my house. Yet, I stand by a lot of my critiques of Western parenting. I think there\'s a lot of questions about how you instill true self-esteem.", Parenting
"Parenting is the hardest thing I have ever done.

"I had three children while doing a show, as demanding as \'Good Morning America,\' so this is - you know, it\'s almost like I\'m less daunted about motherhood, and parenting at this point in time. And I think I\'m just much more fit and healthy than I was 20-years-ago.", Parenting
"As a dad, you are the Vice President of the executive branch of parenting. It doesn\'t matter what your personality is like, you will always be Al Gore to your wife\'s Bill Clinton. She feels the pain and you are the annoying nerd telling them to turn off the lights.", Parenting
"As a teenager I was so insecure. I was the type of guy that never fitted in because he never dared to choose. I was convinced I had absolutely no talent at all. For nothing. And that thought took away all my ambition too.", Teen

"As a teenager you are at the last stage in your life when you will be happy to hear that the phone is for you.", Teen

"My kids idea of a hard life is to live in a house with only one phone.", Teen
"Trouble is, kids feel they have to shock their elders and each generation grows up into something harder to shock.", Teen

"You have teenagers thinking they\'re going to make millions as NBA stars when that\'s not realistic for even 1 percent of them. Becoming a scientist or engineer is.", Teen
"I\'m a teenager, but I\'m independent - I have my own apartment, I have my own life. And I think I have learned more than any of those teenagers have in school. I learned to be responsible, leaving my family and coming here alone.", Teen

"I take mentoring very seriously and I am on the board of an organization called Girls Write Now, where we match teen girls and writing mentors because it changes their lives.", Teen
"You need to know what makes artists tick. Having been through the process myself as a musician, since I was an early teen, gave me an advantage - understanding them from their point of view, because it\'s about them, it\'s not about you - it\'s their vision and what they\'re capable of achieving, and you\'re the conduit.", Teen
"I did work at a mall in college - I think retail/customer service is just one of the most hideous jobs in the world. So I always try to be extra nice when I go into a store. But malls are part of our culture, if you watched any teen comedy in the \'80s. it\'s clear that malls are where we live!", Teen

"The average teen today spends about 35 hours a week in front of a screen of some kind: iPod, movie, TV, video. And a lot of it is good, but a lot of it\'s not. And so I think you\'ve got that five hours a day of media coming into your kid\'s head that\'s creating a lot of havoc out there.", Teen

"The jealousy and resentment that animate the terrorists also affect many of our former cold war allies.", Jealousy
"Religion can make it worse. Are you supposing that if people were encouraged to believe in a transcendent reality, and to be encouraged by grand rituals and music and preaching, to love their neighbors, then they would put jealousy and frustration aside?", Jealousy
"I do a lot of sexy publicity, but I have yet to have any bad experiences regarding jealousy.", Jealousy

"Love is that condition in which the happiness of another person is essential to your own... Jealousy is a disease, love is a healthy condition. The immature mind often mistakes one for the other, or assumes that the greater the love, the greater the jealousy.", Jealousy
"Jealousy is bred in doubts. When those doubts change into certainties, then the passion either ceases or turns absolute madness.", Jealousy

"What makes the pain we feel from shame and jealousy so cutting is that vanity can give us no assistance in bearing them.", Jealousy
"Love shouldn\'t be about jealousy or anything like that. It should be about commitment and being able to trust that person. If you can\'t have that from the get-go, there\'s a problem.", Jealousy
"The surest route to breeding jealousy is to compare. Since jealousy comes from feeling less than another, comparisons only fan the fires.", Jealousy
"To talk about balance, it\'s easier to talk about what\'s out of balance. And I think anytime that you have any disease, and disease meaning lack of ease, lack of flow... dis-ease. So any time there\'s disease, you\'re out of balance, whether it\'s jealousy, anger, greed, anxiety, fear.", Jealousy

"Not many architects have the luxury to reject significant things.", Architecture
"But I absolutely believe that architecture is a social activity that has to do with some sort of communication or places of interaction, and that to change the environment is to change behaviour.", Architecture

"The bungalow had more to do with how Americans live today than any other building that has gone remotely by the name of architecture in our history.", Architecture
"No architect troubled to design houses that suited people who were to live in them, because that would have meant building a whole range of different houses. It was far cheaper and, above all, timesaving to make them identical.", Architecture
"Don\'t clap too hard - it\'s a very old building.", Architecture
"As architects we are often involved in the concrete-steel-and-glass aspect of it, but cities are social structures, and to be involved in imagining the future of cities and the type of relationships and the types of places that we\'re making is something that intrigues me very much.", Architecture
"Color in certain places has the great value of making the outlines and structural planes seem more energetic.", Architecture

"Architecture theory is very interesting.", Architecture
"The loftier the building, the deeper must the foundation be laid.", Architecture
"It is not the beauty of a building you should look at; its the construction of the foundation that will stand the test of time.", Architecture
"But the building\'s identity resided in the ornament.", Architecture
"To work in architecture you are so much involved with society, with politics, with bureaucrats. It\'s a very complicated process to do large projects. You start to see the society, how it functions, how it works. Then you have a lot of criticism about how it works.", Architecture

"Architecture, of all the arts, is the one which acts the most slowly, but the most surely, on the soul.", Architecture

"My favorite hobby is being alone. I like to be alone. I also like dancing, fishing, playing poker sometimes and vegetable gardening - corn, tomatoes, cucumbers, I have a big garden every year.", Gardening

"Rock \'n\' Roll, no roses or gardening.", Gardening
"Overall, the anarchy was the most creative of all periods of Japanese culture for in it there appeared the greatest landscape painting, the culmination of the skill of landscape gardening and the arts of flower arrangement, and the No drama.", Gardening
"In many ways, theatre is more rewarding for a writer. I used to think it was like painting a wall - that when the play is finished, it\'s done - but now I realise it\'s more like gardening; you plant the thing, then you have to constantly tend it. You\'re part of a thing that\'s living.", Gardening
"The garden, by design, is concerned with both the interior and the land beyond the garden.", Gardening

"I do the gardening.", Gardening
"My passion for gardening may strike some as selfish, or merely an act of resignation in the face of overwhelming problems that beset the world. It is neither. I have found that each garden is just what Voltaire proposed in Candide: a microcosm of a just and beautiful society.", Gardening
"In the world at large, people are rewarded or punished in ways that are often utterly random. In the garden, cause and effect, labor and reward, are re-coupled. Gardening makes sense in a senseless world. By extension, then, the more gardens in the world, the more justice, the more sense is created.", Gardening
"Gardening is not trivial. If you believe that it is, closely examine why you feel that way. You may discover that this attitude has been forced upon you by mass media and the crass culture it creates and maintains. The fact is, gardening is just the opposite - it is, or should be, a central, basic expression of human life.", Gardening
"One of the least arduous but most productive of gardening jobs, the magic of deadheading never fails to delight me. It was a revelation when the principle was explained to me: that flowers are the attempt by the plant to reproduce itself.
