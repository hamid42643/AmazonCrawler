"In order to lead a country or a company, you\'ve got to get everybody on the same page and you\'ve got to be able to have a vision of where you\'re going. America can\'t have a vision of health care for everybody, green economy, regulations - can\'t have a bunch of piece-meal activities. It\'s got to have a vision.", Health

"Taste is developed by the diversity of the products one can sample. I think our children today may be missing an education about food. We must teach them to know their cuisine and to know the equilibrium of nourishment. That is very important for health.", Health
"Myths about the dire effects of genetically modified foods on health and the environment abound, but they have not held up to scientific scrutiny.

"Yes, Democrats can prove that America pays more for health care than other countries; yes, they have won the dispute that private health insurance is needlessly expensive. But what they\'ve lost is the argument that we are a society.", Health
"While Democrats fussed with the details of health care reforms, conservatives spent months telling the nation that the real issue is freedom, that what\'s on the line is American liberty itself.", Health

"The average person doesn\'t understand what a stem cell is. There\'s a lack of health literacy in our nation. So the public can\'t really get into this dialogue because they don\'t understand the complexity of stem cells, not the faith-based approach, not the ideological or political, but the science behind stem cells.", Health
"I think what it does is it gives me a much broader perspective than the average politician. You know, having walked in those shoes of being hungry and being homeless. The indignities of not getting health care, or waiting in the public hospital, hoping somebody will care for you. Going to sleep with a toothache because you can\'t go to the dentist.", Health
"Do any of us actually want to live in a world where your boss can decide that he or she is morally opposed to mental health care? What if your employer was morally opposed to getting x-rays or antibiotics? How about just being forced to disclose your private medical information to your employer?", Health
"As 17th U.S. Surgeon General, I was privileged to serve as the nation\'s doctor. I focused much of my time on promoting proven programs and individual steps that lead to good health.", Health

"For example, lead paint in old houses can be a greater threat to children\'s health than lead that may be under some industrial site where there are no children.", Health
"I don\'t think it should be a surprise when we\'re talking about energy and trying to have more home-grown energy, be less reliant on foreign oil when you look at our health care that we\'re trying to get more affordable health care, that these are going to create major debates in this country and be somewhat polarizing.", Health
"I believe we can incentivize more affordable health care in general by better regulating insurance and creating meaningful competition for health care services.", Health
"I would prefer a public option that would be a competitive option that would allow people to buy into a Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, which is a series of private plans.", Health
"Optimism is not inherently a superior way of viewing the world. Certainly doctors will say it might be better for one\'s physical health to be an optimist. But, morally speaking it may not be appropriate in certain circumstances.", Health
"Green exercise improves psychological health.", Health
"When you\'re young, you don\'t think very far ahead. You just think in terms of the next day, the next week, the next competition. You don\'t think about injuries that could threaten your long-term health.", Health

"I can support co-ops if they want to do it as we\'ve known co-ops in America for 150 years - where they serve the purposes of the consuming public, whether it\'s health care or whether it\'s co-ops as we know them in the Midwest, providing electricity or to sell supplies to farmer.", Health
"In today\'s world, it is shortsighted to think that infectious diseases cannot cross borders. By allowing developing countries access to generic drugs, we not only help improve health in those nations, we also help ourselves control these debilitating and often deadly diseases.", Health
"With the loss of Free Choice Vouchers, hundreds of thousands of workers will now be forced to choose between their employers\' unaffordable insurance or going without health care.", Health
"Since 1994, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have considered it politically risky to offer a plan to fix America\'s broken health care system. The American public, though, has paid the price for this silence as health care costs skyrocketed, millions went uninsured, and millions more grappled with financial insecurity and hardship.", Health
"Each State has its own health insurance mandates, and some of them are good, but there are about 1,800 of them all across the Nation, including provisions for acupuncturists, massage therapists, and hair replacements.", Health
"For me, I am left leaning when it comes to health and education, on the right when it comes to defense. So I don\'t know where I come on the political spectrum. And I think this the challenge that a lot of Jordanians have to deal with.", Health
"I don\'t think healthcare\'s a right. The only right you have is the ability to go out on an even playing field and work, and then purchase health insurance, or whatever it is.", Health
"Fixing health care and fixing the economy are two sides of the same coin.", Health
"It\'s correct that I wanted health reform to do more to create choices and promote competition.", Health
"With a host of proposals on the table and a President examining new ideas for health reform, we have an obligation to give real reform our best shot.", Health
"TV does not care about you or what happens to you. It\'s downright bad for your health now, and that\'s not a far-out concept. I think watching the TV news is bad for you. It is bad for your physical health and your mental health.", Health

"The biggest tab the public picks up for fossil fuels has to do with what economists call \'external costs,\' like the health effects of air and water pollution.", Health
"We are spending most of our time in American health care fixing the mistakes that either we in the profession are causing or our patients are, without recognizing it, causing to themselves.", Health
"My personal feeling, if I can interject a political note, is that I don\'t think it is right that basic health care is a privilege. It shouldn\'t be. It should be a right of all human beings. And certainly in the richest country in the world.", Health
"It is true that too much belief can be bad for your health.", Health
"When you get older, your health becomes important to you, things start breaking down, you\'ve always got a different ache or pain.", Health
"I\'d like to see the health care professionals making decisions, not some bureaucrat in Indianapolis working for an insurance company.", Health
"I became a vegetarian out of compassion for animals and to live as healthy as possible. I realized soon after that I was truly concerned with nonviolent consumption and my own health, a vegan diet was the best decision.", Health
"Advances in technology will continue to reach far into every sector of our economy. Future job and economic growth in industry, defense, transportation, agriculture, health care, and life sciences is directly related to scientific advancement.", Health
"Look, I hate to sound like Pollyanna, but I literally can\'t wait to get to work in the morning. I\'ve got steady jobs, I\'ve got my health, and I\'m here in the greatest city in the world. I\'d be a pig not to be grateful.", Health
"Today we have a health insurance industry where the first and foremost goal is to maximize profits for shareholders and CEOs, not to cover patients who have fallen ill or to compensate doctors and hospitals for their services. It is an industry that is increasingly concentrated and where Americans are paying more to receive less.", Health
"But if you\'re asking my opinion, I would argue that a social justice approach should be central to medicine and utilized to be central to public health. This could be very simple: the well should take care of the sick.", Health
"We\'ve taken on the major health problems of the poorest - tuberculosis, maternal mortality, AIDS, malaria - in four countries. We\'ve scored some victories in the sense that we\'ve cured or treated thousands and changed the discourse about what is possible.", Health
"The biggest public health challenge is rebuilding health systems. In other words, if you look at cholera or maternal mortality or tuberculosis in Haiti, they\'re major problems in Haiti, but the biggest problem is rebuilding systems.", Health
"Sleep is that golden chain that ties health and our bodies together.", Health
"Health care reform, the marquee legislative accomplishment of the Obama administration\'s first term, was passed before we entered the world of divided government.", Health

"It\'s never too late to take your heart health seriously and make it a priority.", Health
"How important is failure - yes, failure - to the health of a thriving, innovative business? So important that Ratan Tata, chairman of India\'s largest corporation, gives an annual award to the employee who comes up with the best idea that failed.", Health
"I\'m 58 years old and I just went through 8 back surgeries. They started cutting on me in February 2009, and I was basically bed ridden for almost two years. I got a real dose of reality that if you don\'t have your health, you don\'t have anything.", Health

"Why do we have 47 million people without health care? Because America has become about \'me\'. What\'s happened to \'we\' as a people? I believe in that and that resonates to most people.", Health

"It\'s easier to lecture women on sexual morality than it is to explain why all Americans shouldn\'t have comprehensive, fair, and equal health care coverage.", Health
"Since the reduction of risk factors is the scientific basis for primary prevention, the World Health Organization promotes the development of an integrated strategy for prevention of several diseases, rather than focusing on individual ones.", Health
"That the AIDS pandemic is threatening sustainable development in Africa only reinforces the reality that health is at the center of sustainable development.", Health
"We\'ve had Town Hall meetings, we\'ve witnessed election after election, in which the American people have taken a position on the President\'s health care bill. And the bottom line is the people don\'t like this bill. They don\'t want it.", Health
"You know, there are people making a lot of money in this country who can actually afford their own health care. We are in a situation where we got a safety net in place in this country for people who frankly don\'t need one. We got to focus on making sure we got a safety net for those who actually need it.", Health
"I know that it isn\'t just violence against women, it\'s how do we support ourselves and our families, how do we deal with health care for ourselves and our families? It\'s a bigger picture.", Health
"I don\'t think a director should have any kids. I don\'t even think it\'s good for your physical health. Even guys in their 30s look exhausted because directors never get enough sleep. What I do is stressful enough.", Health
"The majority of Americans receive health insurance coverage through their employers, but with rising health care costs, many small businesses can no longer afford to provide coverage for their employees.", Health
"Finally, the ecological health of the Mississippi River and its economic importance to the many people that make their living or seek their recreation is based on a healthy river system.", Health
"As founder and co-chair of the upper Mississippi River Congressional task force, I have long sought to preserve the river\'s health and historical multiple uses, including as a natural waterway and a home to wildlife, for the benefit of future generations of Americans.", Health
"I understand that in these difficult economic times, the potential for any additional expense is not welcomed by American businesses. But in the long run, the health insurance reform law promises to cut health-care costs for U.S. businesses, not expand them.", Health
"The real cure for what ails our health care system today is less government and more freedom.", Health
"We need to increase access to health insurance through Health Savings Accounts and high deductible policies, so individuals and families can purchase the insurance that\'s best for them and meets their specific needs.", Health
"I believe that music in itself heals and that everything is about the power of the mind. I thought if you are happy, you don\'t get ill. Your health is in your head. When you are satisfied with your work, you don\'t get ill.", Health
"For that story, I took as my subject a young woman whom I got to know over the course of a couple of visits. I never saw her having any health problems - but I knew she wanted to be married.", Health
"Who is there that ever receives a gift and tries to make bargains about it? Let us, then, return thanks for what He has bestowed on us. Who can tell whether, if we had had a larger share of ability or stronger health, we should not have possessed them to our destruction.", Health
"Because what happens is, as the economy suffers, tax revenues go down. But unlike businesses, where at least your variable costs go down, in government your variable costs go up: unemployment insurance, workmen\'s compensation, health care benefits, welfare, you name it.", Health
"Whether the task is fixing health care, upgrading K-12 education, bolstering national security, or a host of other missions, the U.S. is better at patching problems than fixing them.", Health

"In the field of health care, we are giving people access to insurance who have not had it before.", Health
"America\'s doctors, nurses and medical researchers are the best in the world, but our health care system is broken.", Health
"To do what we are doing in this budget to our children, cutting their health care funds, decreasing opportunity, simply so we can pay for tax cuts and a war in Iraq is beyond belief, and we need to reverse it.", Health
"Third issue, and again I think it is important to note, anyone can make a mistake and any administration can make a mistake once in a while, but this is just a long train of abuses, an unbroken chain of following special interests rather than the health of the American people.", Health
"Unfortunately, we are still in an age where individuals may be discriminated against because of health conditions.", Health
"You can\'t make assumptions when you\'re dealing with health issues.", Health
"It is great good health to believe, as the Hindus do, that there are 33 million gods and goddesses in the world. It is great good health to want to understand one\'s dreams. It is great good health to desire the ambiguous and paradoxical.", Health
"The concern right now is that families are paying for insurance, or getting insurance from their employer and trusting that health care will be available for their families. In too many instances now, the care they need isn\'t available.", Health
"I think that we have a number of different health care challenges in our country, and certainly addressing the uninsured is one, and the second is making sure that those with health insurance actually get the care that they assume they\'ll have available to them if they get sick.", Health
"The Patients\' Bill of Rights is necessary to guarantee that health care will be available for those who are paying for insurance. It\'s a part of the overall health care picture.", Health
"The minute health care becomes a huge, unwieldy, expensive government bureaucracy it\'s a permanent feature of life and there\'s nothing anyone can do about it.", Health
"I remember the first pangs of stress arriving at the end of school. Once I graduated I had to get a full-time job, worry about health insurance, saving money, paying rent - things I\'d never thought about before.", Health
"Singing really oxygenates your blood. You stretch your lungs and take in much more air into them than before. It\'s really good for your health.", Health

"During my nearly five years as director-general of WHO, high-level policymakers have increasingly recognized that health is central to sustainable development.", Health
"Intervention for the prevention and control of osteoporosis should comprise a combination of legislative action, educational measures, health service activities, media coverage, and individual counselling to initiate changes in behaviour.", Health
"It\'s long past time we started focusing on the solutions that actually keep women healthy, instead of using basic aspects of women\'s health as a tool of cultural, moral, and political control.", Health
"Few people wear out before their time. Mostly they rust out, worry out, run out - spill out. A machine must have care and its different parts must be adjusted properly. No machine has ever approached the human machine. When it is right, it is in health.", Health
"If Obama wanted to make radical changes to America\'s health long-term, all he has to do is treble the price of sugar and salt.", Health
"I can understand why some people might look at me and say, \'What\'s she got to be depressed about?\' I get that a lot in Britain, where mental health issues seem to be a big taboo.", Health
"Because we spoke so loudly, opponents of reproductive health access demonized and smeared me and others on the public airwaves. These smears are obvious attempts to distract from meaningful policy discussions and to silence women\'s voices regarding their own health care.", Health
"From dear, dear Gloria Swanson, I learned how to live long, happy and free of health problems. I owe her my life.", Health
"For the past two years, President Obama has promised our children the moon, stars, rainbows, unicorns and universal health care for all. But the White House Santa\'s cradle-to-grave entitlement mandates are a spectacularly predictable bust.", Health
"I believe you need scientific proof that something works before you entrust your health to it.", Health
"In the beginning when I sat next to Tom Brokaw on the \'Today\' show, the stories I was interested in were those having to do with women and children and learning and health. In those days, 25 to 30 years ago, that was called soft news, and not in a nice way.", Health
"We can never, ever say it enough: every woman - especially every young woman-has to take charge of her health... and do what\'s right for her!", Health
"I am passionate about talking to women about their breast health.", Health
"We don\'t want the efficiency of the federal government and the compassion of the IRS to run our health care.", Health
"The health care system is really designed to reward you for being unhealthy. If you are a healthy person and work hard to be healthy, there are no benefits.", Health
"It\'s totally different from last year because I came in with good shape with no health worries so it was about going out there and running well and enjoying it.", Health
"I\'m happy that I feel a little less out of place in filmmaking than I once was - but it\'s almost impossible for a playwright in the U.S. to make a living. You can have a play, like I did with \'Angels,\' and it still generates income for me, but it\'s not enough for me to live on and have health insurance.", Health
"I really believe that beauty comes from health - sensible eating and exercise.", Health
"The idea of making access to safe abortions harder and more expensive and more difficult, having to travel across state lines - that puts women\'s health and lives in jeopardy, which is something I think no one wants.", Health
"The truth is I had lots of rehab and now I have a clean bill of health.", Health
"I\'m active in PAX, which is a gun awareness organization. We treat gun safety as a public health issue.", Health
"And there is no getting away from the fact - and this is a key point of discontent among many who are upset with the health care reform bill is it didn\'t go far enough. They say why isn\'t it in place now? Why don\'t I see some benefits now? All I see is the potential for losing insurance coverage, for premiums going up. That\'s hurting Obama.", Health
"When you stop and look at so much of the kind of activism that has been triggered, the Tea Party and the like, as a result of Obama\'s efforts - TARP, the stimulus package, and now the health care reform - there is a lot of sense this government is changing.", Health
"It\'s about businesses nervous about taking on school leavers because of a mass of red tape. It\'s about health and safety regulations and green fines.", Health
"Once brave politicians and others explain the war on drugs\' true cost, the American people will scream for a cease-fire. Bring the troops home, people will urge. Treat drugs as a health problem, not as a matter for the criminal justice system.", Health
"In my forties, my optimism was boundless. I had really good health and tremendous success which allowed me to do anything I wanted.", Health
"Today the demands are for even higher standards in the quality of care, for greater flexibility and convenience in treatment times, and for more prevention through screening and health checks.", Health

"I am interested in getting people to use the healthcare system at the right time, getting them to see the doctor early enough, before a small health problem turns serious.", Health
"Many health care providers, particularly physicians in rural and urban areas, are leaving the Government programs because of inadequate reimbursement rates.", Health
"It\'s time to look beyond the budget ax to assure access to health care for all. It\'s time to look for bipartisan solutions to the problems we can tackle today, and to work together for tomorrow - building a health care system that works for all Americans.", Health
"For the amount of money that the country is going to spend this year on health care, you can go out and hire a doctor for every seven families in the US and pay the doctor almost $230,000 a year to cover them.", Health
"I believe the most important aspect of Medicare is not the structure of the program but the guarantee to all Americans that they will have high quality health care as they get older.", Health
"When the Veterans Affairs Department implemented a program to provide home-based health care to veterans with multiple chronic conditions - many of the system\'s most expensive patients to treat - they received astounding results.", Health
"Without Free Choice Vouchers, there is little in the health reform law that discourages employers from increasingly passing the burden of health care costs onto their employees.", Health
"The reality is that the special interest groups that have lobbied against Free Choice Vouchers object to any measure that would empower employees to have a say in their health benefits because it begins to erode their power in the current health care system.", Health
"It is hard to miss the irony in the fact that the very same week that Republicans were publicly heralding Congressman Paul Ryan\'s plan to inject market forces into the American health care system, they were crafting a budget deal to strip them from the health reform law.", Health
"While Free Choice Vouchers didn\'t fulfill my vision of a health care system in which every American would be empowered to hire and fire their insurance company, they were a foothold for choice and competition and a safety valve for Americans whose employers are already forcing them to bear more and more of their family\'s health insurance costs.", Health
"I agree with just about everyone in the reform debate when they say \'If you like what you have, you should be able to keep it.\' But the truth is that none of the health reform bills making their way through Congress actually delivers on that promise.", Health
"If you like the health insurance that you have you should be able to keep it, but if you don\'t like the health insurance you have, you should be able to choose something else.", Health
"I believe that whether you love your job or hate your job, get laid off or are just in-between jobs, you deserve health care that can never be taken away.", Health
"Under the Healthy Americans Act, you\'re in charge of your health care - not your employer. If you lose your job, change jobs or just can\'t find a job, your health insurance is guaranteed to stick with you.", Health
"I should do something about the cigarettes; I quite accept that it\'s bad for your health, but you know a moderate tipple is positively beneficial and, at certain times, absolutely essential.", Health
"Do you suppose there is any living man so unreasonable that if he found himself stricken with a dangerous ailment he would not anxiously desire to regain the blessing of health?", Health
"I don\'t know of a Democrat - whether they\'re a conservative, a centrist or a liberal Democrat - that doesn\'t think that it\'s important to have quality jobs that pay decent wages so that families can support themselves, so that they can have the dignity of being able to afford health care, put money aside for pension, buy a home.", Health
"I don\'t know if there is a Democrat who necessarily doesn\'t believe health care is a right instead of privilege. There is a significant between us and the Republican Party on that issue.", Health
"I have a computer screen near my seat where I monitor the overall health of the vehicle and pick up any problems that might be occurring early on or once we see any kind of a malfunction or anything unusual that\'s happening, we can look at the data and figure out what that is.", Health
"For those that are working part time, in small businesses, or who are unemployed and do not currently have health insurance, we want to make sure that you are covered.", Health
"Please be assured that as we move along through the implementation of health insurance reform, making sure that we find efficiencies within the existing system, is foremost on the President\'s mind.", Health
"President Obama stands ready to work with everyone, because that\'s what the American people expect and deserve - not for the short term political advantages, but the long term health of our country. We don\'t spend time trying to figure out what\'s in the minds of Republicans, we try to keep our focus on the American people.", Health
"The Roman Curia has its defects, but it seems to me that people often overemphasize its defects and talk too little about the health of the many religious and laypeople who work there.", Health
"If investments in banks fall, it is a tragedy, and people say, \'What are we going to do?\' but if people die of hunger, have nothing to eat or suffer from poor health, that\'s nothing.", Health
"This is a matter of public health. The public was sick and tired of DeLay and his corruption.", Health
"Decades ago, women suffered through horrifying back-alley abortions. Or, they used dangerous methods when they had no other recourse. So when the Republican Party launched an all-out assault on women\'s health, pushing bills to limit access to vital services, we had to ask: Why is the GOP trying to send women back... to the back alley?", Health

"The biggest mistakes, early on, involved foreign policy and involved the strategy for health care.", Health
"On health care, virtually every political error that could be made was made.", Health
"Prior to passage of Obamacare, Americans spoke out against the individual mandate; they didn\'t want to change the health care they had; they didn\'t want a 3,000-page bill that empowered 15 Washington bureaucrats to decide the future of the doctor-patient relationship.", Health
"Americans want and deserve a broad array of health insurance choices so they can identify those that best fit their own individual or family needs. These choices expand when we allow free enterprise to foster innovation, not smother it with taxes and one-size fits all ideology.", Health
"Originally created to serve the poorest and sickest among us, the Medicaid program has grown dramatically but still doesn\'t include the kind of flexibility that states need to provide better health care for the poor and disadvantaged.", Health
"The national debate on health care once centered on improving access to quality care, yet the effect of Obamacare will be the exact opposite, resulting in the shameful degradation of care for the neediest individuals.", Health
"Obamacare is a seriously flawed law that makes health care coverage less affordable, costs taxpayers more than advertised and fails to deliver on most of its other grand promises.", Health
"Giving governors more leeway in administering health care could represent a small, positive development in the ongoing saga of Obamacare. Unfortunately, instead of choosing flexibility, President Obama and his left-leaning advisers always default to rigid \'Washington knows best\' answers.", Health
"Hot, dry katabatic winds, like the south foehn in Europe, the sharav in the Middle East, and the Santa Ana of Southern California, are all believed to have a decided effect on human behavior and are associated with such health problems as migraines, depression, lethargy, and moodiness. Some scientists say that this is a myth.", Health

"My father was a small-town banker. He became very ill when I was 10 years old, and we went to California three years later in an attempt to recover his health, which never happened.", Health
"We see tremendous excitement from small-business people about the administration and about the attention and commitment that the president has to do things that really make a difference. I think they recognize that health care is one of those. I think they recognize that what we\'ve been doing in the Recovery Act with our loan programs has mattered.", Health
"Small businesses pay 18 percent more than big businesses for health care, the same health care, just because they\'re small and they have too small a pool of risk.", Health
"If you think about it, candidate Obama, Sen. Obama, was running on sort of long-run economic issues, like restoring prosperity to the middle class, dealing with the perennial problem of health care in the United States. He talked a lot about the budget deficit, about the need to transition to clean energy.", Health
"A successful argument for a government manufacturing policy has to go beyond the feeling that it\'s better to produce \'real things\' than services. American consumers value health care and haircuts as much as washing machines and hair dryers.", Health
"Even if you walk exactly the same route each time - as with a sonnet - the events along the route cannot be imagined to be the same from day to day, as the poet\'s health, sight, his anticipations, moods, fears, thoughts cannot be the same.", Health

By the same token, even the best-stocked delivery system will have an inadequate impact if it fails to reach the poor.", Health
"The International Health Partnership Plus is addressing the need to harmonize development assistance and reduce the current waste, duplication, and high transaction costs.", Health
"WHO has a country office in nearly every developing country, usually located close to the Ministry of Health. Staff in these offices need to do much more to help ministries of health strengthen their national health plans and strategies and then negotiate with development partners to support these priorities and follow these plans.", Health
"New diseases like SARS and bird flu cause anxiety in the community. People get worried, some to the extent that it even affects their health. You feel very sad, and yet you must carry on and maintain your cool in very trying and difficult moments. You have to tough it out.", Health
"The World Health Organization did a world health report in 2006. In the whole world about 60 countries are in dire situation in terms of having enough doctors. And many of these countries are in Sub-Saharan Africa. You know, that part of the world alone needs one million doctors.", Health
"I want us to be judged by the impact we have on the health of the people of Africa and the health of women. Improvements in the health of the people of Africa and the health of women are key indicators of the performance of WHO. This is a health organization for the whole world...

"The U.N. Population Fund has a maternal health program in some Cameroon hospitals, but it doesn\'t operate in this region. It\'s difficult to expand, because President Bush has cut funding.", Health
"Every country in the world is battling the rising cost of health care. No community anywhere has demonstrably lowered its health-care costs (not just slowed their rate of increase) by improving medical services. They\'ve lowered costs only by cutting or rationing them.", Health
"Cost is the spectre haunting health reform. For many decades, the great flaw in the American health-care system was its unconscionable gaps in coverage.", Health
"The health-care sector certainly employs more people and more machines than it did. But there have been no great strides in service. In Western Europe, most primary-care practices now use electronic health records and offer after-hours care; in the United States, most don\'t.", Health

"If you look at things that really affect people\'s lives - sport, the arts, charities - they were always at the back of the queue for government money - health, social security, defence, pensions were all way ahead.

"It\'s never occurred to me to worry about my health, or that I\'ll get old, or that people will stop laughing at me.", Health
"I think the British people are very, very attached to the idea that the health service is free at the point of use. But there is no reason why every doctor, nurse and teacher in this country has to be employed by the state.", Health

And it must be opposed.", Health

"I\'m not really a morning person.", Morning
"Four hours of makeup, and then an hour to take it off. It\'s tiring. I go in, I get picked up at two-thirty in the morning, I get there at three.

"My goal is to get home every day in time for dinner with the family - and then we play with the kids for a while, and then I go to bed around the time they do and sleep from nine to three or nine to four. It\'s the same six hours everyone else gets. I\'d just rather do my e-mails and my reading in the morning rather than late at night, that\'s all.", Morning

"There\'s pros and cons of a big church. Cons is I don\'t get to know everybody, I don\'t get to go to their ballgame, I don\'t get to marry everybody, but the pros are you get all this community, 800 ushers come in to serve, getting there at 7 in the morning on their day off and coming in on Saturday to make all those wafers.", Morning

"I often write either really early in the morning, or really late at night.", Morning
"Throughout my 20s I spent a lot of time just playing and not really working, but fortunately for me I continued to get just enough work, and have a reason to wake up in the morning. I really empathize with some of my peers who had success in the early years then it dries up, and so there\'s no reason to get up in the morning.", Morning
"I was lucky enough to grow up in a home where I woke up Christmas morning and had toys. I know that\'s not the case with all people and I don\'t think kids should go without experiencing that sort of joy.", Morning

"In the morning, I reach for the sports page.", Morning

"I squeeze oranges every morning to make juice.", Morning
"Four hours of prosthetics every morning, the jowls and the nose, and it was very hot so they\'re having to attend to it all day, and you\'re still petrified of so many things, such as, can I speak properly? Hitchcock never quite lost those East End vowels, even though he had the softened California consonants.", Morning
"It\'s such a luxury to be able to be happy about going to work in the morning.", Morning
"I do Yoga. I\'d like to say I do it every morning, but I don\'t, I just don\'t have the time.", Morning
"How can a doctor judge a woman\'s sanity by merely bidding her good morning and refusing to hear her pleas for release? Even the sick ones know it is useless to say anything, for the answer will be that it is their imagination.", Morning
"I\'ve found myself at one in the morning just sitting at my desk spending an hour returning emails from the day until like two in the morning. It\'s ridiculous, I should be sleeping, or dreaming, or reading a novel.", Morning
"I am up at 3:30, reading the op-ed pages and getting ready to be on the air by 6 A.M. on the set of \'Morning Joe,\' and after three hours of TV and two hours on the radio, it is only 12 noon.", Morning

"I\'d skip school regularly to see movies - even in the morning, in the small Parisian theaters that opened early.", Morning
"I have a sense of destiny because of my mother, who was an extraordinary person but a terrible candidate for mother. She was like the god Cronus, who gave birth to his children in the morning and then ate them at night.", Morning
"I could announce one morning that the world was going to blow up in three hours and people would be calling in about my hair!", Morning
"So you wake up this morning and find you\'re president of the United States. Pretty cool, no? Helicopters and a 747 at your disposal; courtside seats at any NBA playoff game of your choice; everyone stands up and the band plays when you come into the room.", Morning
"Work is a prayer, and I start off every morning dedicating it to our Creator.", Morning
"I wake up every morning singing \'The Star-Spangled Banner.\'", Morning
"There\'s some things you just have to live with. Like twelve cars camping outside your house, and when you wake up in the morning, they\'re going to follow you wherever you go. It helps that I live in Valencia. It eliminates some. But they\'re still here.", Morning
"You show up in Paris, and on the drive from the airport to the hotel you\'re like, \'This is so cool! I want to see something! I want to go to the Eiffel Tower!\' And then you leave the next morning. You think, Oh, I didn\'t get to do anything. I tell people: I\'ve been just about everywhere, but I\'ve seen nothing.", Morning
"The greatest job I ever had was working on my family farm. Each morning my father would come into my bedroom around 4:30 am and command me to get up and work the fields. I would spend the next two hours before school slopping pigs and cropping tobacco.", Morning

"Men and women were declared equal one morning and everybody could divorce each other by postcard.", Morning
"My life had become a catastrophe. I had no idea how to turn it around. My band had broken up. I had almost lost my family. My whole life had devolved into a disaster. I believe that the police officer who stopped me at three a.m. that morning saved my life.", Morning
"Almost every morning I write in my journal. I\'ve been keeping it for a long time - I\'ve filled more than 50 books. I write about what\'s going on in my personal and spiritual life or what\'s going on at work. It helps me keep things in perspective, especially when things get crazy or I get stressed or we have obstacles.", Morning
"We hear the stories every day now: the father who puts on a suit every morning and leaves the house so his daughter doesn\'t know he lost his job, the recent college grad facing up to the painful reality that the only door that\'s open to her after four years of study and a pile of debt is her parents\'. These are the faces of the Obama economy.", Morning

"I don\'t have to get up in the morning and go beat up my body like I used to. I don\'t have to be out there in August in 108 degree weather down in Texas.", Morning
"Sydney in general is eclectic. You can be on that brilliant blue ocean walk in the morning and then within 20 minutes you can be in a completely vast suburban sprawl or an Italian or Asian suburb, and it\'s that mix of people, it\'s that melting pot of people that give it its vital personality.", Morning
"The episodes all blend together for me, so I don\'t remember. I can\'t even remember what I had for breakfast this morning. I always feel I must be such a disappointment to them.", Morning
"I don\'t have an iPod. I mean, I have a couple. Doesn\'t everyone? But I don\'t use it. I need to because I go to the gym now, and I\'m tired of listening to morning radio. I want some music! I do have a video iPod, but I don\'t use it either.", Morning
"The worst part about pregnancy would definitely have to be my nausea. I don\'t know why it\'s just called morning sickness because morning sickness never just happened in the morning for me and it\'s not happening just in the morning for my sister.", Morning

"For days on end, I avoid the Web, never logging in until about two or three, after I\'ve written all morning. On a good week, I don\'t go online till after Wednesday, so four or five days might lapse without my checking e-mail.", Morning
"I never really drank coffee in college, but now I\'m on my feet all day and out all night and can\'t believe it hasn\'t always been in my life. When morning comes I crave it.", Morning
"It is always with excitement that I wake up in the morning wondering what my intuition will toss up to me, like gifts from the sea. I work with it and rely on it. It\'s my partner.", Morning
"I am a morning writer; I am writing at eight-thirty in longhand and I keep at it until twelve-thirty, when I go for a swim. Then I come back, have lunch, and read in the afternoon until I take my walk for the next day\'s writing.", Morning
"I am, in fact, Superman. Every morning I wake up and go into a telephone booth and change my costume, and then go to work.", Morning
"I was a very undisciplined person but acting was something that actually motivated me to get up in the morning. I hadn\'t experienced that before, but it was something that really excited me. I think I could be quite self-conscious and it gave me a release.", Morning

"I\'m a mom - I\'m lucky if I get to shower in the morning. Luckily, nail polish stays on my toes. I\'ve been so bad on the upkeep, though.", Morning
"I have a hotline to the tabloids. When I get up in the morning, I call the Star, and the last thing at night, I call them. I want them to have the inside track.", Morning
"I was so obsessed by this problem that I was thinking about it all the time - when I woke up in the morning, when I went to sleep at night - and that went on for eight years.", Morning
"You know, the men go to tea houses with the expectation that they will have a nice quiet evening and not read about it the next morning in the newspaper.", Morning

"If I\'m working on a film, I\'ll do sit-ups for before I shoot. Like, 100 in the morning or something.", Morning

"I have to say when we talk about the treatment of these prisoners that I would guess that these prisoners wake up every morning thanking Allah that Saddam Hussein is not in charge of these prisons.", Morning
"Chronic malnutrition, or the lack of proper nutrition over time directly contributes to three times as many child deaths as food scarcity. Yet surprisingly, you don\'t really hear about this hidden crisis through the morning news, Twitter or headlines of major newspapers.", Morning
"I don\'t know why you call it morning sickness, because I was sick all day and night!", Morning
"You\'d have to think that you\'re at least decent, or you couldn\'t get up every morning and do it. I think if I live long enough, I might be pretty good.", Morning
"Even as a kid, I never liked breakfast. I just don\'t like to eat then. I like to get up and work. I think sticking a whole bunch of carbohydrates in your stomach in the morning is probably the worst way to begin the day.", Morning
"Nobody has time to keep trying on a load of things in the morning like a teenager.", Morning
"Chelsea Morning is a great Joni Mitchell song and I guess I\'m partial to her lyrics because they show me a slightly different perspective on life.", Morning
"Prince used to call me up 3am in the morning and invite me to hear some of his new songs.", Morning
"We were doing it under the most extraordinary circumstances, but the first out of the tent in the morning would be David Lean. He said to me on the very first day of shooting, Pete, this is the beginning of a great adventure.", Morning
"You say something stupid and the next morning you\'re in the headlines.", Morning
"When I get up in the morning I brush my teeth and go about my business, and if I am going anywhere interesting I take my camera along.", Morning
"I still love doing what I do, and I\'m really lucky to get up in the morning and want to go to work.", Morning
"Those golden minutes before you are completely awake, when your mind is just drifting, you have no censorship; you are ready to develop any kind of idea. That\'s when I come up with the best and worst ideas. That is the privilege of being a writer - that you can stay in bed for an hour in the morning and it\'s work time.", Morning
"A lot of people think Formula One isn\'t a sport because everyone drives a car when they go to work in the morning. But we\'re pulling up to six G on a corner or during breaking, which is almost like being a fighter pilot. So we have to do a lot of work on our neck muscles.", Morning
"The thing with me is, if I wake up one morning and I\'m not happy working as an actress, I\'ll stop. It\'s not something I have to do. It\'s not a vocation.", Morning
"I don\'t mind traveling that much when I can go somewhere and stay there for a while, but touring is different. You rarely see anything. You get there early in the morning and you\'re resting all day, and you go in and do a sound check, and you do the show, and then bam you\'re gone.", Morning
"Now the only thing I miss about sex is the cigarette afterward. Next to the first one in the morning, it\'s the best one of all. It tasted so good that even if I had been frigid I would have pretended otherwise just to be able to smoke it.", Morning
"I started running 3 miles every morning after throat surgery to remove a cyst last year. The gym used to be my adversary. But that has all changed. Now, I look forward to it every morning.", Morning

"Life would be very dreary if there were no magic. If the real world were only that veil of tears, I just don\'t think could get up in the morning.", Morning
"Hitchhiking was such a pure form of existence. You\'d wake up in the morning, and you\'d have no idea what your day was going to be. And that\'s something I\'ve never been able to shake. I loved that.", Morning
"My principal motivation is supporting my family, which is not a bad reason for getting up in the morning. That\'s always been my motivation - to take care of the people who rely on me.", Morning
"I eat as much as the next girl, but I work my butt of in the gym every morning! The key is moderation. I splurge on the weekend. A big bowl of pasta and a delicious slice of cake for dessert are my favorites.", Morning
"Normal people don\'t just wake up in the morning and say I think it\'d be a good idea to run for president of the United States.", Morning
"I never laugh or smile when I am writing. When I come home for lunch after writing all morning, my wife says I look like I just came home from a funeral. This is not bragging. This is an illness.", Morning
"Yes, I still love \'South Park,\' but I also love morning TV now.", Morning
"What I don\'t like is breakfast in the morning. I have a double-espresso cappuccino, but no food.", Morning
"I spent every night until four in the morning on my dissertation, until I came to the point when I could not write another word, not even the next letter. I went to bed. Eight o\'clock the next morning I was up writing again.", Morning

"I, a late riser, fantasise about getting up every morning at 5 A.M. to fetch the horses in from the fields.", Morning
"I try to shave at night so my skin has a chance to settle by the early morning call-time.", Morning
"After the first day of practice, there\'s not one guy who\'s playing at 100 percent or who feels great. Sometimes, getting up in the morning and brushing your teeth is the hardest part of the day - it just hurts.", Morning
"Sometimes in the morning, when it\'s a good surf, I go out there, and I don\'t feel like it\'s a bad world.", Morning
"London is completely unpredictable when it comes to weather. You\'ll start a scene, and it\'s a beautiful morning. You get there at 6 in the morning, set up, you start the scene, start shooting. Three hours later, it is pitch black and rainy.", Morning
"You feel a little older in the morning. By noon I feel about 55.", Morning
"I exercise every morning. I do light weights - 5lb and 10lb arm exercises - and then lie and lift my arms and legs. It\'s all about keeping core strength. I do a lot of stretching too.", Morning
"We went to a small lake, Bass Lake. It was beautiful. It was perfectly still when we got there in the morning. The fog was lifting off the water. It was just magical. And we did catch some fish, 13 fish.", Morning
"The question is the morning after. What sort of Iraq do we wake up to after the bombing? What happens in the region? What impact could it have? These are questions leaders I have spoken to have posed.", Morning
"When a man has been consistently battering his wife, he shouldn\'t expect a bouquet of roses from her the morning after he promises to stop.", Morning
"I don\'t want to clip on the armour every morning. I\'ve seen some politicians do this and they get a bit mangled and bitter. I just refuse to do that. I refuse to be angry or bitter or complain, and I remain open. I may sometimes be a bit too open but I\'m not going to change that one bit.", Morning
"One thing I\'ve very quickly learned is that if you wake up every morning worrying about what\'s in the press, you would go completely and utterly potty.", Morning
"Later, in the early teens, I used to ride my bike every Saturday morning to the nearest airport, ten miles away, push airplanes in and out of the hangars, and clean up the hangars.", Morning
"It\'s not easy waking up every single morning knowing what you\'re going to put your body through and having to do it. We don\'t have days off.", Morning
"Let me tell you, sisters, seeing dried egg on a plate in the morning is a lot dirtier than anything I\'ve had to deal with in politics.", Morning
"I am really passionate about my career and my music and I am so lucky to be able to do what I do for a job, so for all the early morning starts and long days, I could never trade it all in.", Morning
"My brain is so anxiety-prone, like a pinball machine. If I don\'t get up in the morning and focus my thinking, my breathing, and my being for about 12 minutes, I\'m just a screwball all day long.", Morning
"I\'m obsessed with radio. It\'s a good start to Sunday morning.", Morning
"A real New Yorker likes the sound of a garbage truck in the morning.", Morning
"The most used piece of kit in my kitchen is my saucepan. I use it every morning to cook my porridge in. The least used piece of equipment? I\'d say a food mixer. I\'ve never used it, I don\'t really know what they\'re for.", Morning
"I have a Viking stove. The color is butter lemon, and I had to wait several months for it, because that color wasn\'t available and I really wanted butter lemon! But I don\'t know that it\'s seriously ever been cooked on. I mean, I make tea every morning. Does that count?", Morning
"I loved fantasy, but I particularly loved the stories in which somebody got out of where they were and into somewhere better - as in the \'Chronicles Of Narnia,\' \'The Wizard Of Oz,\' \'The Phantom Tollbooth,\' the \'Dungeons & Dragons\' cartoon on Saturday morning in the \'80s.", Morning
"Most of the top actors and actresses may be working in ten or twelve films at the same time, so they will give one director two hours and maybe shoot in Bombay in the morning and Madras in the evening. It happens.", Morning
"I don\'t go to Mass every day. But I go to church every day. Just sitting there, thinking - it\'s a great way to start the morning, you know? You feel so good coming out, and your approach to everything is suddenly really clear.", Morning
"I\'m very silly as a person, but quality silliness on-screen has more of an art to it. Harrison Ford, whom I was in \'Morning Glory\' with, has mastered that dry funny better than anyone.", Morning
"I have mugs of hot water every morning because the studio is cold, and also because it makes my throat sound clearer.", Morning
"On \'Morning Joe\' I can say what I think, be my sometimes unorthodox self, have fun, yet be serious as well.", Morning
"Both my mum and dad were great readers, and we would go every Saturday morning to the library, and my sister and I had a library card when we could pass off something as a signature, and all of us would come with an armful of books.", Morning
"I was the type of guy that used to get up in the morning and go out and just out run everybody on the field without stretching or warming up or anything.", Morning
"Early in the morning, I fell in love with the girl that later on became my wife. At that time, we were so naive. I wanted to charm her, so I read her Capital by Marx. I thought somehow she would be convinced by the strength of his criticism about capital.", Morning
"I wake up early in the morning and walk for an hour. If I have something to write, I prefer to write in the morning until midday, and in the afternoon, I eat.", Morning

"She got the magazine on a Wednesday morning, and on Thursday announced our marriage was over.", Morning
"I\'ve never been a TV junkie. I remember watching Letterman way back when he had a morning show.", Morning
"I remember those days right after I graduated from college. All I had to do was wake up in the morning and think about writing songs. It\'s not like that anymore, needless to say.", Morning
"Too much coffee. Too much coffee and Gatorade. It\'s a hell of a mix. If you\'re ever tired in the morning, just try that mix, and tell me what you think.", Morning
"We know that a man can read Goethe or Rilke in the evening, that he can play Bach and Schubert, and go to his day\'s work at Auschwitz in the morning.", Morning
"Remember my first tenet in getting dressed is how you feel in the morning. So if you\'re not being true blue to that, it usually shows.", Morning
"I have to say that when you tour the world, obviously, the jetlags and different hours and ways of living and traveling, a lot of hours in the plane, and you wake up in the morning and you\'re not quite sure where you are, and it is very tiring.", Morning
"It is a challenge, with the global fame, to try to act like I put my pants on one leg at a time, when in fact I have Pippa Middleton help me put my pants on every morning. She\'s my lady-in-waiting as well.", Morning
"I worked at Salon.com way back when they started, and there\'s just unmeasurable value to distributing words online, too, but I still get my news from the newspaper in the morning.", Morning
"If have to undergo preschool safety checks every morning, why does a random thug get to own an assault rifle?", Morning
"I am not a morning person.", Morning
"You\'ve got to get up every morning with determination if you\'re going to go to bed with satisfaction.", Morning
"\'Good Morning America\' exploited Joan Lunden\'s pregnancy, but you won\'t see me bringing my babies on the air. The only reason I\'m talking about the babies at all is that they\'ve been with me on the show since I became pregnant. After a while, I had to acknowledge this pumpkin tummy.", Morning
"I know I have to be like people expect, because people love to dream with me, they like to think that I love my boat of 50 metres, that I drink Cristal for breakfast, that I dance until five o\'clock in the morning. I am not like that.", Morning
"I always like to start my morning with a good amount of fruit. I really like pineapple, particularly because of the enzymes that it has. Sometimes I have oatmeal. But if I\'m feeling like I really want to be watching my weight more, then I definitely do a protein, like an omelet, scrambled eggs or some smoked salmon.", Morning
"Yeah, I\'m not really a morning person.", Morning
"I really am super lazy and doing long hair, especially mine, is a big pain in the butt. It\'s filled with cowlicks and kinks and curls and frizz - and it was taking too much time in the morning.", Morning
"I don\'t have a single complete show or movie or anything else that I could look at and say, \'Nailed that one.\' But endless dissatisfaction is, I suppose, what gets us out of bed in the morning.", Morning
"Previously, on Lock, Stock, I went to bed at two in the morning and woke up at five in the morning, and on this one I was known to nod off on the set occasionally.", Morning
"What is news? It\'s hard to quantify. Certainly news has changed completely, and the morning shows are not really designed to bring you the news, except to tell you what happened overnight, and the rest of it is a kind of magazine mentality - a little bit of this, a little bit of that. It\'s harder to be an educated and informed citizen.", Morning
"I get up in the morning and do a seven-minute yoga workout. I know the most likely time I\'m going to do something is when I first get up, and I make it short because, like you, I don\'t really want to do that first thing in the morning.", Morning
"The boy who expects every morning to open into a new world finds that today is like yesterday, but he believes tomorrow will be different.", Morning

"What is life, when wanting love? Night without a morning; love\'s the cloudless summer sun, nature gay adorning.", Morning

"You know how you wake up in the morning and sometimes you look gorgeous and other times you look like you got hit by a mack truck? I realized that my mack truck is food. If I have no sugar, yeast or wine, I have no undereye bags and my skin is perfect.", Morning
"We all wake up in the morning wanting to live our lives the way we know we should. But we usually don\'t, in small ways. That\'s what makes a character like Batman so fascinating. He plays out our conflicts on a much larger scale.", Morning
"When I was in the hospital they gave me apple juice every morning, even after I told them I didn\'t like it. I had to get even. One morning, I poured the apple juice into the specimen tube. The nurse held it up and said, \'It\'s a little cloudy.\' I took the tube from her and said, \'Let me run it through again,\' and drank it. The nurse fainted.", Morning
"Most songs have meager beginnings. You wake up in the morning, you throw on your suspenders, and you subvocalize and just think. They seem to form like calcium. I can\'t think of a story right off the bat that was that interesting. I write things on the back of my hand, usually, and sing into a tape recorder.", Morning
"A city with one newspaper, or with a morning and an evening paper under one ownership, is like a man with one eye, and often the eye is glass.", Morning
"One thing that happens when you\'re pregnant is that as your stomach starts to stretch. It itches! So I have to keep my belly really lubricated. Every morning, there\'s a buttering ceremony after I get out of the shower. It\'s really like basting a turkey with body butter.", Morning
"When I get up in the morning and put on a pink or a green wig, I see myself as a piece of animation. It lets me be the person I want to be, a person who\'s not embarrassed to have fun.", Morning
"I have an orthopedic pillow that\'s made out of a sponge material. I have a plate in my throat, and I have to be careful or I could end up with a bad neck in the morning. That pillow is a must everywhere I go.", Morning
"Now, on nights that I can\'t sleep, I play video games alone until the morning.", Morning
"Of all the songs I\'ve recorded, \'Amarillo By Morning\' always sticks out in my mind.", Morning
"My wife gets all the money I make. I just get an apple and clean clothes every morning.", Morning
"I don\'t want to be in my car all day. I love getting up in the morning in Venice and walking my dogs down to the cafe to get my tea, and then perhaps going to a bookstore and sitting and reading, then walking to the beach.", Morning
"When I go out clubbing I can dance \'til three o\'clock in the morning with just a water bottle in my hand. I love dancing to anything with a good beat really. My favorite song to dance to at the moment is probably Drake\'s \'Best I Ever Had.\'", Morning
"My days, if they start in the morning with a cuddle from my son, are just so much more glorious than they were prior to that.", Morning
"The repose of sleep refreshes only the body. It rarely sets the soul at rest. The repose of the night does not belong to us. It is not the possession of our being. Sleep opens within us an inn for phantoms. In the morning we must sweep out the shadows.", Morning
"Remember that we can only in our forebrains handle 5-7 items. Our backbrains can handle massive amounts. So when you\'re given a problem, think about it before you go sleep, and chances are you can solve it by the next morning.", Morning
"It\'s very important to write things down instantly, or you can lose the way you were thinking out a line. I have a rule that if I wake up at 3 in the morning and think of something, I write it down. I can\'t wait until morning - it\'ll be gone.", Morning
"But when I felt like I had something to prove? Then I got up early every morning and worked all day long. I didn\'t know if I had any more talent than anyone else directing, but I knew I could work hard at it, and so I did.", Morning

"I will check the internet for at least an hour every morning scanning worldwide news to do with child abuse.

"In order to have good fried chicken, you should wash and season the bird the morning you\'re preparing it for dinner. Don\'t wait and do it right before you start cooking.

"My personality, when tasked with creating meals, goes something like this: Is there a way we can make this more difficult? Because let\'s do that. I don\'t mean to complicate things. It\'s just - why buy pre-packaged potato salad when you can spend your morning boiling potatoes and flipping out because there\'s no dill in the house?", Morning

"I just enjoy life now. I just enjoy every morning I get to wake up.", Morning

Most of it\'s just whining, but every so often there\'ll be something I can use later: a joke, a description, a quote.

"There is a one woman in China that claimed she paid $50 to get my e-mail address. It was pretty shocking. I got one this morning from Scotland. A girl\'s requesting a signed photo of me.", Morning
"I was taught that to create anything you had to believe in failure, simply because you had to be prepared to go through an idea without any fear.

"I see myself at 7:30 in the morning and it\'s not too pretty.", Morning

"I like to try to do a little work before I do anything in the morning, even if it\'s a paragraph.", Morning
"I\'m very happy with the way I look. I wake up some morning, catch myself in the bathroom mirror, and go, \'hey girl, you\'re alright\'. But on the other hand, I find the website stuff, and the polls, something completely removed from my own personal life. You can\'t take anything like that too seriously, otherwise you\'d end up in the loony bin.", Morning
"I obviously take a lot of pride in what I do on the football field, because that has the ability to influence a lot of people. That puts smiles on people\'s faces. That gives people a pep in their step on Monday morning when they go back to work.", Morning

"When I first broke through, there was only NBC, CBS and ABC, and they had news in the morning and in the evening - there wasn\'t no 24-hour news.", Morning

"While I have felt lonely many times in my life, the oddest feeling of all was after my mother, Lucille, died. My father had already died, but I always had some attachment to our big family while she was alive. It seems strange to say now that I felt so lonely, yet I did.", Family
"There is a common theme, though, in the stories I have told, which are usually associations of characters or families that are formed outside of a family circle.", Family

You\'re almost in a haze because you don\'t really know where you are half the time: You\'re in a hotel room one moment, and the next thing you know, you\'re onstage performing for 60,000 people, then you\'re back on an airplane. It\'s very hectic and I couldn\'t do it without my family.", Family

"I\'m from a nice, suburban, middle-class family, but my tattoos remind me where I\'ve been.", Family
"Even though I have a nice house, nice family, the rest of my generation is still in South Central L.A. My cousins, my brothers, my sisters, they don\'t wanna move out. They don\'t want to and they don\'t have the means to sustain it. That\'s where my heart is and that\'s what I think about all the time.", Family
"Look, I\'ve got incredible pride for my family. I\'ve absolutely fallen into that cliche of a dad who could just happily talk about my daughter endlessly.", Family
"South Central is just who I am. Even though I have a nice house, nice family, the rest of my generation is still in South Central L.A. My cousins, my brothers, my sisters, they don\'t wanna move out.", Family
"There was a great complexity to my father. He was a devoted family man. But, in the same breath, he simply was not suited to an anchored life. He should have been somebody who had a backpack, an old map, a bit of change in his pocket and that was it - roaming the world.", Family

"I was always on the go, and thought I was too busy to develop something like this. I thought at the time that diabetes went along with bad habits, but I was the last one in my family to eat junk food.", Family
"I don\'t want to be reincarnated, that\'s for sure. When you\'ve had rewarding experiences in your life - a loving family, friends - you don\'t need additional reassurances that you\'re going to do something with a new cast of characters. I\'d just as soon pass.", Family
"My whole family is very sarcastic and constantly making jokes.", Family
"Family is the one thing that is definitely not disposable.", Family
"We need a better way to talk about eating animals, a way that doesn\'t ignore or even just shruggingly accept things like habits, cravings, family and history but rather incorporates them into the conversation. The more they are allowed in, the more able we will be to follow our best instincts.", Family
"The purpose of the Seder to my mind is to inspire conversations with your family about the human drama and hopefully transmit values to the next generation. I\'ve always felt like this could be better.", Family
"My family put a lot of emphasis on homework, so there weren\'t too many comic books or video games for me, when I was growing up.", Family
"I remember saying goodbye to my father the night he left to join the Navy. He didn\'t have to. He was older than other servicemen and had a family to support but he wanted to be a part of the fight against fascism, not just make movies about it. I admired this about him.", Family
"I went through a period of great rebellion within my family, when I was about 9 or 10. I was mad, I had no focus, had no real interest in anything, and so I started to do things that were just rebellious and stupid.", Family
"In my family, in the days prior to television, we liked to while away the evenings by making ourselves miserable, solely based on our ability to speak the language viciously.", Family

"We\'ll sort of get over the marriage first and then maybe look at the kids. But obviously we want a family so we\'ll have to start thinking about that.", Family
"The one thing that kept our family together was the music. The only thing that our family would share emotionally was to have our dad cry over something the kids did with music.", Family

"We\'ll be going to the fish market and a farmer\'s market this afternoon to get what we need to make and eat dinner as a family. I\'m trying to expose my kids to going to a farmers market or the fish market and learning what that\'s all about.", Family
"Pious XII was too neutral to mention the gas chambers; decent people like my own family were turned into devils by crude Christianity.", Family
"I want to be inspiring to myself, to my kids, my family, and my friends.", Family
"I was lucky. My family is wonderful. And it\'s funny, because most of my best friends come from very large families. So it always felt as if I had lots of siblings, though in the end I had to leave them and go home. I kind of got the best of both worlds as a kid.", Family
"For our immediate family and relatives, Canada was a land of opportunity.", Family

"This show has been a major revitalization of my family life and personal life. It gave my family an avenue to speak to me honestly.", Family

"I\'ve always known I wanted a family.", Family

"You can be cool and at the same time respect your woman, who will hopefully become your wife, who will hopefully become the mother of your kids. America needs to get back to family values.", Family
"We have it, we\'re lucky enough that we\'ve created a show where it\'s not about... a family, or a kid, it\'s about a town.", Family
"Our family was on the lunatic fringe. My mother was always completely irrepressible. My father made crowd noises into a microphone.", Family
"Whole communities are growing up without fathers or male role models. Bringing up a family in the best of circumstances is not easy. To try to do it by placing the entire burden on women - 91% of single-parent families in Britain are headed by the mother, according to census data - is practically absurd and morally indefensible.", Family
"Make space in your life for the things that matter, for family and friends, love and generosity, fun and joy. Without this, you will burn out in mid-career and wonder where your life went.", Family

"We do not always appreciate the role the Queen has played in one of the most significant changes in the past 60 years: the transformation of Britain into a multi-ethnic, multi-faith society. No one does interfaith better than the Royal family, and it starts with the Queen herself.", Family

"Jews have deep respect for the Queen and the royal family. We say a prayer for them every Sabbath in synagogue. We recite a special blessing on seeing the Queen.", Family

"I have one friend that I\'ve had since I was born, and she\'s from Coatzacoalcos. She\'s not really impressed or interested in the actor\'s life. My family isn\'t really either.", Family

"Mitt Romney comes from a family of builders.", Family

"Roots is not just a saga of my family. It is the symbolic saga of a people.", Family
"When you go to the movies with your whole family, it\'s a different experience. For some reason, it\'s something that you\'re all doing together and you take away something special in that.", Family

"I grew up in a family in which political issues were often discussed, and debated intensely.", Family
"My whole damn family was nice. I don\'t think I\'ve imagined it. It\'s true. Maybe it has to do with being brought up as Christian Scientists. Half of my relatives were Readers or Practitioners in the church.", Family
"My family background was deeply Christian.", Family
"The joke in our family is that we can cry reading the phone book.", Family
"We went to church every Sunday. When I was a kid, the only time I sang was around my family.", Family

"Being a Barrymore didn\'t help me, other than giving me a great sense of pride and a strange spiritual sense that I felt OK about having the passion to act. It made sense because my whole family had done it and it helped rationalise it for me.", Family
"I grew up in a family that was multifaceted, sexually oriented, and pretty much open to everything. And because I was working, my friends were all adults. I had a tough time going to different schools because people knew me from films and I was the fat child who got beaten up every day.", Family
"When I did \'E.T.,\' it sort of solidified the only family I know are these film crews. These gypsies. These filmmakers. That was the solidification and the clicking revelations of \'This is what I want to do with my life and this is where I\'m going to survive.\'", Family

"There is good in everything; it\'s just how you choose to look at it. Everything that\'s worth it has a price. For me to be a model - I had to leave my family. Do you think I liked that? No! There are sacrifices. Life is meant to be a challenge, because challenges are what make you grow.", Family

"If you share a common ancestor with somebody, you\'re related to them. It doesn\'t mean that you\'re going to invite them to the family reunion, but it means that you share DNA.", Family
"You can say I had a severe case of \'Roots\' envy. I wanted to be like Alex Haley, and I wanted to be able to... do my family tree back to the slave ship and then reverse the Middle Passage, as I like to put it, and find the tribe or ethnic group that I was from in Africa.", Family
"So when you do your family tree and Margaret Cho does hers, and... Wanda Sykes and John Legend... we\'re adding to the database that scholars can then draw from to generalize about the complexity of the American experience. And that\'s the contribution that family trees make to broader scholarship.", Family

"The kitchen really is the castle itself. This is where we spend our happiest moments and where we find the joy of being a family.", Family
"I understood that my family was rich in love but would probably never own the land my father, John, dreamed of owning. My mother, Willie Ella Mays Clarke, was a washerwoman for poor white folks in the area of Columbus, Georgia where the writer Carson McCullers once lived.", Family
"As the eldest son of an Alabama sharecropper family, I was constantly troubled by a collage of North American southern behaviors and notions in reference to the inhumanity of people.

"And so I look at it as a relationship that I have with him that I want to give him the honor and glory anytime I have the opportunity. And then right after I give him the honor and glory, I always try to give my teammates the honor and glory. And that\'s how it works because Christ comes first in my life, and then my family, and then my teammates.", Family
"Because I didn\'t have brothers, I was always interested in the kids down the street that had four brothers in their family, so I became one of them - but it was not my family. I\'ve always been attracted to temporary families. They tend to be lost characters.", Family
"I need my family to remind me in a loving and nice way to lighten up.", Family
"My wife, my family, my friends - they\'ve all taught me things about love and what that emotion really means. In a nutshell, loving someone is about giving, not receiving.", Family

"My father really was not the dominant person who raised the family, it was my mother who raised the family.", Family

"I have yet to see a drama that puts forward women who are successful and also have a family... they are nearly always seen as victims.", Family
"We all wish we could be in more than one place at the same time. People with families feel guilty all the time-if we spend too much time with our family, we feel we\'re not working hard enough.", Family
"One person may need (or want) more leisure, another more work; one more adventure, another more security, and so on. It is this diversity that makes a country, indeed a state, a city, a church, or a family, healthy. \'One-size-fits-all,\' and that size determined by the State has a name, and that name is \'slavery.\'", Family
"My kids are the future of the Mayweather family and of the Mayweather brand. I feel our family is stronger if we stay together.", Family

"Whenever I have friends over, we end up eating and talking and losing track of time, and, once in a while, singing karaoke. It reminds me of the family meals we had in Russia, which always lasted a very long time. That\'s a tradition I miss.", Family

"This character feels so much like my brother. He has two children. He has a wife. He works with me. He chooses to stay in New Hampshire because he wants his kids to grow up in the school they started with. He doesn\'t want them to lose friends. He is his family\'s hero.", Family

"My family and friends treat me as they always have.", Family
"I contribute my best in my sport and I also have a ton of respect for myself and my family.", Family

"I think the American Dream says that anything can happen if you work hard enough at it and are persistent, and have some ability. The sky is the limit to what you can build, and what can happen to you and your family.", Family

"My kids say if there\'s any family dinner that doesn\'t result in somebody crying, it\'s not a good dinner. They cry because it helps relieve them of a guilt or some onerous emotional burden. It\'s like a family tradition.", Family
"There\'s a schizoid streak within the family anyway so I dare say that I\'m affected by that. The majority of the people in my family have been in some kind of mental institution, as for my brother he doesn\'t want to leave. He likes it very much.", Family

"I\'ve never had a very closely connected family. My parents split up when I was young and I was living with my mom for a little while, then I was kind of just on my own really young.

"My family and I built my whole career from scratch.", Family
"I\'d like to have a family.", Family

"I think we need to look for any opening we can to avoid a war and we shouldn\'t pass up any opportunity for resolution.", War
"You cannot be politically correct in a war.", War
"In reality, Republicans have long been at war with clean energy. They have ridiculed investments in solar and wind power, bashed energy-efficiency standards, attacked state moves to promote renewable energy and championed laws that would enshrine taxpayer subsidies for fossil fuels while stripping them from wind and solar.", War
"Maybe more climate activists will think about the climate change not as an international problem to be resolved in an air-conditioned meeting hall, but as a guerilla war to be fought in the streets.", War

"Look at an infantryman\'s eyes and you can tell how much war he has seen.", War
"When I was in Pulp, I actively did more TV stuff because that was during the Great Britpop Wars, and it seemed important to prove that indie people could speak. That war doesn\'t exist anymore.", War

"A doctrine of class war seemed to provide a solution to the problem of poverty to people who know nothing about how wealth is created.", War
"I am an opponent of Saddam Hussein, but an opponent also, of the sanctions that have killed a million Iraqi children and an opponent of the United States\' apparent desire to plunge the Middle East into a new and devastating war.", War
"I think Chris Rock at the Oscars was a great example. I thought that was intellectually hilarious. The Gap starts a war with Banana Republic... That to me was funny.", War

"I was proud of the youths who opposed the war in Vietnam because they were my babies.", War

"War is fear cloaked in courage.", War
"Fighting a war on terrorism is like fighting against crime. We can never hope to eradicate crime, so we shouldn\'t bother fighting it.", War
"What have we achieved since the end of the Second World War? We have allowed petty, bourgeois regimes in which everything is average, mediocre.", War
"It has been, after all, 11 years, more than a decade now, of defiance of U.N. resolutions by Saddam Hussein. Every obligation that he signed onto after the Gulf War, so that he would not be a threat to peace and security, he has ignored and flaunted.", War
"There is an alternative to war. It has been with us forever.", War
"Nothing is more useless in developing a nation\'s economy than a gun, and nothing blocks the road to social development more than the financial burden of war. War is the arch enemy of national progress and the modern scourge of civilized men.", War

"I think the majority of the British people are still sanguine about the need for war.", War
"The question is: how bad do things have to get before you will do something about it? Where is your line in the sand? If you don\'t enforce the constitutional limitations on your government very soon, you are likely to find out what World War III will be like.", War
"The Sandinista government became consumed with fighting a war of survival. They were up against the biggest superpower in the world.", War
"You know, this is a war of ideology, a war of thoughts and of faith. And we need people to really stand for faith and trust, not hope and change.", War

"History teaches that war begins when governments believe the price of aggression is cheap.", War
"Telling us to obey instinct is like telling us to obey \'people.\' People say different things: so do instincts. Our instincts are at war... Each instinct, if you listen to it, will claim to be gratified at the expense of the rest.", War

"You say it is the good cause that hallows even war? I say unto you: it is the good war that hallows any cause.", War

"My first wish is to see this plague of mankind, war, banished from the earth.", War
"War has always been the grand sagacity of every spirit which has grown too inward and too profound; its curative power lies even in the wounds one receives.", War
"Part of what I loved - and love - about being around older people is the tangible sense of history they embody. I\'m interested in military history, for instance, because both my grandfathers fought in World War II. I\'m interested in writing because one of those grandfathers wrote books.", War
"The fact is that America has been at her most prosperous when government and the private sector have been not at war, but in a wary, if often underplayed, alliance. History is unmistakable on this point.", War

"In war, whichever side may call itself the victor, there are no winners, but all are losers.", War
"They have called Operation Iraqi Freedom a war of choice that isn\'t part of the real war on terror. Someone should tell that to al Qaeda.", War
"I\'m actually reading \'World War Z\' again! It\'s incredibly realistic and it\'s written as an oral history through interviews with different characters. Max Brooks wrote this book in so many different voices. There are about forty or so. It\'s incredible.

"I feel like war should occur only for the most vital and necessary reasons, and only then.", War
"I think the record speaks for itself. These are two individuals who have been for the war when the headlines were good and against it when their poll ratings were bad.", War
"I think that horror films have a very direct relationship to the time in which they\'re made. The films that really strike a film with the public are very often reflecting something that everyone, consciously or unconsciously feeling - atomic age, post 9-11, post Iraq war; it\'s hard to predict what people are going to be afraid of.", War
"I am still profoundly troubled by the war in Nicaragua. The United States launched a covert war against another nation in violation of international law, a war that was wrong and immoral.", War
"It\'s very important to go back and keep in mind the distinction between handling these events as criminal acts, which was the way we did before 9/11, and then looking at 9/11 and saying, \'This is not a criminal act,\' not when you destroy 16 acres of Manhattan, kill 3,000 Americans, blow a big hole in the Pentagon. That\'s an act of war.", War
"I think that NATO is itself a war criminal.", War
"From our perspective, trying to deal with this continuing campaign of terror, if you will, the war on terror that we\'re engaged in, this is a continuing enterprise. The people that were involved in some of those activities before 9/11 are still out there.", War

"A democracy which makes or even effectively prepares for modern, scientific war must necessarily cease to be democratic. No country can be really well prepared for modern war unless it is governed by a tyrant, at the head of a highly trained and perfectly obedient bureaucracy.", War
"Four years ago, I promised to end the war in Iraq. We did. I promised to refocus on the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9/11. We have. We\'ve blunted the Taliban\'s momentum in Afghanistan, and in 2014, our longest war will be over. A new tower rises above the New York skyline, al Qaeda is on the path to defeat, and Osama bin Laden is dead.", War
"All war is based on deception.", War

"A war between Europeans is a civil war.", War
"Civil war? What does that mean? Is there any foreign war? Isn\'t every war fought between men, between brothers?", War

"Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards looks for victory.", War

"In war the heroes always outnumber the soldiers ten to one.", War
"We\'ve used up a lot of bullets. And we talk about stimulus. But the truth is, we\'re running a federal deficit that\'s 9 percent of GDP. That is stimulative as all get out. It\'s more stimulative than any policy we\'ve followed since World War II.", War
"Cliches about supporting the troops are designed to distract from failed policies, policies promoted by powerful special interests that benefit from war, anything to steer the discussion away from the real reasons the war in Iraq will not end anytime soon.", War

"A sad fact of life lately at the Museum of Modern Art is that when it comes to group shows of contemporary painting from the collection, the bar has been set pretty low.", Art
"The alchemy of good curating amounts to this: Sometimes, placing one work of art near another makes one plus one equal three. Two artworks arranged alchemically leave each intact, transform both, and create a third thing.", Art
"Everyone goes to the same exhibitions and the same parties, stays in the same handful of hotels, eats at the same no-star restaurants, and has almost the same opinions. I adore the art world, but this is copycat behavior in a sphere that prides itself on independent thinking.", Art

"\'Summer of Love: Art of the Psychedelic Era,\' the Whitney Museum\'s 40th-anniversary trip down counterculture memory lane, provides moments of buzzy fun, but it\'ll leave you only comfortably numb.

"I love to collect modern art.", Art
"Those who love him love that he sells the most art; they take it as a point of faith that this proves Kinkade is the best. But his fans don\'t only rely on this supply-and-demand justification. They go back to values.", Art
"The reason the art world doesn\'t respond to Kinkade is because none - not one - of his ideas about subject-matter, surface, color, composition, touch, scale, form, or skill is remotely original. They\'re all cliche and already told.", Art
"Kinkade\'s paintings are worthless schmaltz, and the lamestream media that love him are wrong. However, I\'d love to see a museum mount a small show of Kinkade\'s work. I would like the art world and the wider world to argue about him in public, out in the open.", Art
"Auction houses run a rigged game. They know exactly how many people will be bidding on a work and exactly who they are. In a gallery, works of art need only one person who wants to pay for them.", Art
"Artschwager\'s art always involves looking closely at surfaces, questions what an object is, wants to make you forget the name of the thing you\'re looking at so that it might mushroom in your mind into something that triggers unexpected infinities.", Art
"Early-twentieth-century abstraction is art\'s version of Einstein\'s Theory of Relativity. It\'s the idea that changed everything everywhere: quickly, decisively, for good.", Art

"If the Frieze Art Fair catches on, I imagine at least two great things happening. First, we will once again have a huge art fair in town that isn\'t too annoying to go to. More importantly, Frieze may finally show New Yorkers that we can cross our own waters for visual culture. That would change everything.", Art
"Art is for anyone. It just isn\'t for everyone. Still, over the past decade, its audience has hugely grown, and that\'s irked those outside the art world, who get irritated at things like incomprehensibility or money.", Art
"I often find myself privately stewing about much British art, thinking that except for their tremendous gardens, that the English are not primarily visual artists, and are, in nearly unsurpassable ways, literary.", Art
"A metaphysical tour de force of untethered meaning and involuting interlocking contrapuntal rhythms, \'The Clock\' is more than a movie or even a work of art. It is so strange and other-ish that it becomes a stream-of-consciousness algorithm unto itself - something almost inhuman.", Art
"I don\'t know much about auctions. I sometimes go to previews and see art sardined into ugly rooms. I\'ve gawked at the gaudy prices, and gaped at well-clad crowds of happy white people conspicuously spending hundreds of millions of dollars.", Art
"I love art dealers. In some ways, they\'re my favorite people in the art world. Really. I love that they put their money where their taste is, create their own aesthetic universes, support artists, employ people, and do all of this while letting us see art for free. Many are visionaries.", Art
"When museums are built these days, architects, directors, and trustees seem most concerned about social space: places to have parties, eat dinner, wine-and-dine donors. Sure, these are important these days - museums have to bring in money - but they gobble up space and push the art itself far away from the entrance.", Art
"I see 30 to 40 gallery shows a week, and no matter what kind of mood I\'m in, no matter how bad the art is, I almost always feel better afterward. I can learn as much from bad art as from good.", Art
"Jeffrey Deitch is the Jeff Koons of art dealers. Not because he\'s the biggest, best, or the richest of his kind. But because in some ways he\'s the weirdest (which is saying a lot when you\'re talking about the wonderful, wicked, lovable, and annoying creatures known as art dealers).", Art
"Many say an art dealer running a museum is a \'conflict of interest.\' But maybe the art world has lived an artificial or unintentional lie all of these years when it comes to conflicts of interest.", Art
"Of course art world ethics are important. But museums are no purer than any other institution or business. Academics aren\'t necessarily more high-minded than gallerists.", Art
"We\'re all entitled to opinions about how art institutions should behave, and entitled to voicing those opinions through whatever means available to us. We\'re also allowed to change or modify our opinions.", Art
"The art of newspaper paragraphing is to stroke a platitude until it purrs like an epigram.", Art

"The basis of art is truth, both in matter and in mode.", Art
"Art is one thing that can go on mattering once it has stopped hurting.", Art
"Of course the illusion of art is to make one believe that great literature is very close to life, but exactly the opposite is true. Life is amorphous, literature is formal.", Art
"I\'m very manipulative towards directors. My theory is that everyone on the set is directing the film, we\'re all receiving art messages from the universe on how we should do the film.", Art
"I\'m very much into the costuming of any character that I portray and it\'s one of the great things about making movies is it\'s a collaborative art form so you get all these artists who are looking specifically about for this instance your character\'s costume and what that might tell about your character.", Art
"Writing stopped being fun when I discovered the difference between good writing and bad and, even more terrifying, the difference between it and true art. And after that, the whip came down.", Art
"It\'s important to debunk the myths of Africa being this benighted continent civilized only when white people arrived. In fact, Africans had been creators of culture for thousands of years before. These were very intelligent, subtle and sophisticated people, with organized societies and great art.", Art
"It has taken me years of struggle, hard work and research to learn to make one simple gesture, and I know enough about the art of writing to realize that it would take as many years of concentrated effort to write one simple, beautiful sentence.", Art
"Intolerance respecting other people\'s religion is toleration itself in comparison with intolerance respecting other people\'s art.", Art
"I am an anarchist in politics and an impressionist in art as well as a symbolist in literature. Not that I understand what these terms mean, but I take them to be all merely synonyms of pessimist.", Art
"All good criticism should be judged the way art is. You shouldn\'t read it the way you read history or science.", Art
"Only in men\'s imagination does every truth find an effective and undeniable existence. Imagination, not invention, is the supreme master of art as of life.", Art
"I think it\'s pretentious to create art just for the sake of stroking the artists ego.", Art
"All art is exorcism. I paint dreams and visions too; the dreams and visions of my time. Painting is the effort to produce order; order in yourself. There is much chaos in me, much chaos in our time.", Art
"The art of the parenthesis is one of the greatest secrets of eloquence in Society.", Art
"Art is the human disposition of sensible or intelligible matter for an esthetic end.", Art

"The web of life is a beautiful and meaningless dance. The web of life is a process with a moving goal. The web of life is a perfectly finished work of art right where I am sitting now.", Art
"I never studied art, but taught myself to draw by imitating the New Yorker cartoonists of that day, instead of doing my homework.", Art
"I think no artist can claim to have any access to the truth, or an authentic version of an event. But obviously they have slightly better means at their disposal because they have their art to energize whatever it is they\'re trying to write about. They have music.", Art
"When you are learning about a martial art, it is about respect.", Art
"There is in fact no such thing as art for art\'s sake, art that stands above classes, art that is detached from or independent of politics. Proletarian literature and art are part of the whole proletarian revolutionary cause.", Art
"The art of effective listening is essential to clear communication, and clear communication is necessary to management success.", Art
"In an era ruled by materialism and unstable geopolitics, art must be restored to the center of public education.", Art
"If only life could be a little more tender and art a little more robust.", Art
"Politics is the art of the possible.", Art
"It seems almost backwards to me that my music seems the more emotional outlet, and the art stuff seems more about ideas.", Art
"I love fashion. I love couture. I\'m going to erect a shelf in my bedroom with an art light to be the spot for the shoes of the month.", Art
"I love prints of skulls and bones and have some taxidermy - a crow and a rabbit - to remind me of home. I like art and have a big portrait of Bjork.", Art
"All art is erotic.", Art
"Film is a very young art that is still evolving. Soon, we shall reach a balance between content and technology.", Art
"I think that is what film and art and music do; they can work as a map of sorts for your feelings.", Art
"Art is the symbol of the two noblest human efforts: to construct and to refrain from destruction.", Art
"When you live under the power of terror and segregation, you can\'t ever start a work of art.", Art
"There are so many reactions to art that make sense to me - but \'ick\' means something.", Art
"Insurrection is an art, and like all arts has its own laws.", Art
"The greatest work of art about New York? The question seems nebulous. The city\'s magic and majesty are distilled in the photographs of Alfred Stieglitz and Paul Strand.", Art
"Abstract Expressionism - the first American movement to have a worldwide influence - was remarkably short-lived: It heated up after World War II and was all but done for by 1960 (although visit any art school today and you\'ll find a would-be Willem de Kooning).", Art
"My culture-deprived, aspirational mother dragged me once a month from our northern suburb - where the word art never came up - to the Art Institute of Chicago. I hated it.", Art
"I\'m noticing a new approach to art making in recent museum and gallery shows. It flickered into focus at the New Museum\'s \'Younger Than Jesus\' last year and ran through the Whitney Biennial, and I\'m seeing it blossom and bear fruit at \'Greater New York,\' MoMA P.S. 1\'s twice-a-decade extravaganza of emerging local talent.", Art
"Outside museums, in noisy public squares, people look at people. Inside museums, we leave that realm and enter what might be called the group-mind, getting quiet to look at art.", Art
"It took the Metropolitan Museum of Art nearly 50 years to wake up to Pablo Picasso. It didn\'t own one of his paintings until 1946, when Gertrude Stein bequeathed that indomitable quasi-Cubistic picture of herself - a portrait of the writer as a sumo Buddha - to the Met, principally because she disliked the Museum of Modern Art.", Art
"Appropriation is the idea that ate the art world. Go to any Chelsea gallery or international biennial and you\'ll find it. It\'s there in paintings of photographs, photographs of advertising, sculpture with ready-made objects, videos using already-existing film.", Art
"After its hothouse incubation in the seventies, appropriation breathed important new life into art. This life flowered spectacularly over the decades - even if it\'s now close to aesthetic kudzu.", Art
"The New York art world readily proves people wrong. Just when folks say that things stink and flibbertigibbet critics wish the worst on us all because we\'re not pure enough, good omens appear.", Art
"Artistic qualities that once seemed undeniable don\'t seem so now. Sometimes these fluctuations are only fickleness of taste, momentary glitches in an artist\'s work, or an artist getting ahead of his audience (it took me ten years to catch up to Albert Oehlen). Other times, however, these problems mean there\'s something wrong with the art.", Art
"Can space break? I mean the space of art galleries. Over the past 100 years, art galleries have gone from looking like Beaux Arts salons to simple storefronts to industrial lofts to the gleaming giant white cubes of Chelsea with their shiny concrete floors.", Art
"It\'s great that New York has large spaces for art. But the enormous immaculate box has become a dated, even oppressive place. Many of these spaces were designed for sprawling installations, large paintings, and the Relational Aesthetics work of the past fifteen years.", Art
"The giant white cube is now impeding rather than enhancing the rhythms of art. It preprograms a viewer\'s journey, shifts the emphasis from process to product, and lacks individuality and openness. It\'s not that art should be seen only in rutty bombed-out environments, but it should seem alive.", Art
"It\'s art that pushes against psychological and social expectations, that tries to transform decay into something generative, that is replicative in a baroque way, that isn\'t about progress, and wants to - as Walt Whitman put it - \'contain multitudes.\'", Art
"Much good art got made while money ruled; I like a lot of it, and hardship and poverty aren\'t virtues. The good news is that, since almost no one will be selling art, artists - especially emerging ones - won\'t have to think about turning out a consistent style or creating a brand. They\'ll be able to experiment as much as they want.", Art
"When money and hype recede from the art world, one thing I won\'t miss will be what curator Francesco Bonami calls the \'Eventocracy.\' All this flashy \'art-fair art\' and those highly produced space-eating spectacles and installations wow you for a minute until you move on to the next adrenaline event.", Art
"A saboteur in the house of art and a comedienne in the house of art theory, Lawler has spent three decades documenting the secret life of art. Functioning as a kind of one-woman CSI unit, she has photographed pictures and objects in collectors\' homes, in galleries, on the walls of auction houses, and off the walls, in museum storage.", Art
"Works of art often last forever, or nearly so. But exhibitions themselves, especially gallery exhibitions, are like flowers; they bloom and then they die, then exist only as memories, or pressed in magazines and books.", Art
"If only we could persuade galleries to observe a fallow period in which, for two months every other year, new and old works of art could be sold in back rooms and all main galleries would be devoted to revisiting shows gone by.", Art
"A canon is antithetical to everything the New York art world has been about for the past 40 years, during which we went from being the center of the art world to being one of many centers.", Art
"It took me twenty years to get Steven Parrino\'s work. From the time I first saw his art, in the mid-eighties, I almost always dismissed it as mannered, Romantic, formulaic, conceptualist-formalist heavy-metal boy-art abstraction.", Art
"\'Untitled\' is a time machine that can transport you to 1992, an edgy moment when the art world was crumbling, money was scarce, and artists like Tiravanija were in the nascent stages of combining Happenings, performance art, John Cage, Joseph Beuys, and the do-it-yourself ethos of punk. Meanwhile, a new art world was coming into being.", Art
"Many art-worlders have an if-you-say-so approach to art: Everyone is so scared of missing out on the next hot artist that it\'s never clear whether people are liking work because they like it or because other people do. Everyone is keeping up with the Joneses, and there are more Joneses than ever.", Art
"Art is either plagiarism or revolution.", Art
"I\'ve been called many names like perfectionist, difficult and obsessive. I think it takes obsession, takes searching for the details for any artist to be good.", Art
"Lesser artists borrow, great artists steal.", Art
"Every artist writes his own autobiography.", Art
"Drawing is like making an expressive gesture with the advantage of permanence.", Art
"A sculptor is a person who is interested in the shape of things, a poet in words, a musician by sounds.", Art
"When I work, and in my art, I hold hands with God.", Art
"Art is the stored honey of the human soul, gathered on wings of misery and travail.", Art
"The perfection of art is to conceal art.", Art
"I choose a block of marble and chop off whatever I don\'t need.", Art
"Wherever art appears, life disappears.", Art
"An artist is never ahead of his time but most people are far behind theirs.", Art
"I don\'t think there\'s any artist of any value who doesn\'t doubt what they\'re doing.", Art
"Art is a revolt against fate. All art is a revolt against man\'s fate.", Art
"My hand is the extension of the thinking process - the creative process.", Art
"My painting does not come from the easel.", Art
"Every other artist begins with a blank canvas, a piece of paper the photographer begins with the finished product.", Art
"Time extracts various values from a painter\'s work. When these values are exhausted the pictures are forgotten, and the more a picture has to give, the greater it is.", Art
"I like to pretend that my art has nothing to do with me.", Art
"The creative act lasts but a brief moment, a lightning instant of give-and-take, just long enough for you to level the camera and to trap the fleeting prey in your little box.", Art
"All great art is born of the metropolis.", Art
"To make pictures big is to make them more powerful.", Art
"The beauty one can find in art is one of the pitifully few real and lasting products of human endeavor.", Art
"I\'ve never really had a hobby, unless you count art, which the IRS once told me I had to declare as a hobby since I hadn\'t made money with it.", Art
"The principles of true art is not to portray, but to evoke.", Art
"I think about my work every minute of the day.", Art
"Art hurts. Art urges voyages - and it is easier to stay at home.", Art
"Mournful and yet grand is the destiny of the artist.", Art
"Rationalism is the enemy of art, though necessary as a basis for architecture.", Art
"That\'s the motivation of an artist - to seek attention of some kind.", Art
"The artist one day falls through a hole in the brambles, and from that moment he is following the dark rapids of an underground river which may sometimes flow so near to the surface that the laughing picnic parties are heard above.", Art
"The artist\'s world is limitless. It can be found anywhere, far from where he lives or a few feet away. It is always on his doorstep.", Art
"Art doesn\'t transform. It just plain forms.", Art
"Painting is by nature a luminous language.", Art
"Artists don\'t make objects. Artists make mythologies.", Art
"My love of fine art increased - the more of it I saw, the more of it I wanted to see.", Art
"The principle of art is to pause, not bypass.", Art
"Vision is the true creative rhythm.", Art
"A painting that is well composed is half finished.", Art
"Beauty in art is often nothing but ugliness subdued.", Art
"To an engineer, good enough means perfect. With an artist, there\'s no such thing as perfect.", Art
"The works must be conceived with fire in the soul but executed with clinical coolness.", Art
"Art is the unceasing effort to compete with the beauty of flowers - and never succeeding.", Art
"Vitality is radiated from exceptional art and architecture.", Art
"The history of modern art is also the history of the progressive loss of art\'s audience. Art has increasingly become the concern of the artist and the bafflement of the public.", Art
"It is a mistake for a sculptor or a painter to speak or write very often about his job. It releases tension needed for his work.", Art
"Trying to force creativity is never good.", Art
"The writer, when he is also an artist, is someone who admits what others don\'t dare reveal.", Art
"When I think of art I think of beauty. Beauty is the mystery of life. It is not in the eye it is in the mind. In our minds there is awareness of perfection.", Art
"Art is an invention of aesthetics, which in turn is an invention of philosophers... What we call art is a game.", Art
"Playing a Fender is an art itself. They\'re always going out of tune.", Art
"I try to give people a different way of looking at their surroundings. That\'s art to me.", Art
"A copy of the universe is not what is required of art; one of the damned things is ample.", Art
"There is no logical reason why the camel of great art should pass through the needle of mob intelligence.", Art
"Art is I; science is we.", Art
"The problem is that once the rules of art are debunked, and once the unpleasant realities the irony diagnoses are revealed and diagnosed, \'then\' what do we do?", Art
"Fashion often starts off beautiful and becomes ugly, whereas art starts off ugly sometimes and becomes beautiful.", Art
"Art must take reality by surprise.", Art
"Although all the good arts serve to draw man\'s mind away from vices and lead it toward better things, this function can be more fully performed by this art, which also provides extraordinary intellectual pleasure.", Art
"What I\'m doing is art - it\'s low-brow art but there\'s a magic in that.", Art
"Politics is the art of the possible; creativity is the art of the impossible.", Art
"Wushu is a move in Chinese, a physical move. An attack. Wushu is like an art.", Art
"Good art provides people with a vocabulary about things they can\'t articulate.", Art
"Galleries began growing in both number and size in the late seventies, when artists who worked in lofts wanted to exhibit their work in spaces similar to the ones the art was made in.", Art
"There\'s something pleasing about large, well-lit spaces. I love that dealers are willing to take massive chances in order to give this much room to their artists. Most of all, I love that more galleries showing more art gives more artists a shot.", Art
"First let me report that the art in the Barnes Collection has never looked better. My trips to the old Barnes were always amazing, but except on the sunniest days, you could barely see the art. The building always felt pushed beyond its capacity.", Art
"Not to say people shouldn\'t get rich from art. I adore the alchemy wherein artists who cast a complex spell make rich people give them their money. (Just writing it makes me cackle.) But too many artists have been making money without magic.", Art
"Damien Hirst is the Elvis of the English art world, its ayatollah, deliverer, and big-thinking entrepreneurial potty-mouthed prophet and front man. Hirst synthesizes punk, Pop Art, Jeff Koons, Marcel Duchamp, Francis Bacon, and Catholicism.", Art
"Anyone who relishes art should love the extraordinary diversity and psychic magic of our art galleries. There\'s likely more combined square footage for the showing of art on one New York block - West 24th Street between Tenth and Eleventh Avenues - than in all of Amsterdam\'s or Hamburg\'s galleries.", Art
"Yes, 85 percent of the art you see isn\'t any good. But everyone has a different opinion about which 85 percent is bad. That in turn creates fantastically unstable interplay and argument.", Art
"Many museums are drawing audiences with art that is ostensibly more entertaining than stuff that just sits and invites contemplation. Interactivity, gizmos, eating, hanging out, things that make noise - all are now the norm, often edging out much else.", Art
"Imagine it\'s 1981. You\'re an artist, in love with art, smitten with art history. You\'re also a woman, with almost no mentors to look to; art history just isn\'t that into you. Any woman approaching art history in the early eighties was attempting to enter an almost foreign country, a restricted and exclusionary domain that spoke a private language.", Art
"Willem de Kooning is generally credited for coming out of the painterly gates strong in the forties, revolutionizing art and abstraction and reaching incredible heights by the early fifties, and then tailing off.", Art
"I also take pleasure in the so-called negative power in Grotjahn\'s work. That is, I love his paintings for what they are not. Unlike much art of the past decade, Grotjahn isn\'t simply working from a prescribed checklist of academically acceptable, curator-approved \'isms\' and twists.", Art
"It is not possible to overstate the influence of Paul Cezanne on twentieth-century art. He\'s the modern Giotto, someone who shattered one kind of picture-making and invented a new one that the world followed.", Art
"If a building becomes architecture, then it is art.", Art
"No heirloom of humankind captures the past as do art and language.", Art
"The artist who aims at perfection in everything achieves it in nothing.", Art
"Photography is a major force in explaining man to man.", Art
"When that shutter clicks, anything else that can be done afterward is not worth consideration.", Art
"I think an artist\'s responsibility is more complex than people realize.", Art
"Modern art is what happens when painters stop looking at girls and persuade themselves that they have a better idea.", Art
"Light in Nature creates the movement of colors.", Art
"Art in Nature is rhythmic and has a horror of constraint.", Art
"In an artwork you\'re always looking for artistic decisions, so an ashtray is perfect. An ashtray has got life and death.", Art
"Artists themselves are not confined, but their output is.", Art
"You begin with the possibilities of the material.", Art
"Murals in restaurants are on a par with the food in museums.", Art
"The more horrifying this world becomes, the more art becomes abstract.", Art
"Art is the desire of a man to express himself, to record the reactions of his personality to the world he lives in.", Art
"Culture is the arts elevated to a set of beliefs.", Art
"It is art that makes life, makes interest, makes importance and I know of no substitute whatever for the force and beauty of its process.", Art
"Art is subject to arbitrary fashion.", Art
"When I make art, I think about its ability to connect with others, to bring them into the process.", Art
"Every time a student walks past a really urgent, expressive piece of architecture that belongs to his college, it can help reassure him that he does have that mind, does have that soul.", Art
"I think of my peace paintings as one long poem, with each painting being a single stanza.", Art
"I paint with shapes.", Art
"Art ought never to be considered except in its relations with its ideal beauty.", Art
"I\'m not gonna give the British Government the joy of keeping taxing me. They don\'t tax art. And all my cars are just a collection of art.", Art
"I was the least Pop of all the Pop artists.", Art
"They teach you there\'s a boundary line to music. But, man, there\'s no boundary line to art.", Art
"The smart thing in the art world is to have one good idea and never have another.", Art
"I\'m not interested in pop art.", Art
"These days, newish art can be priced between $10,000 and $25,000. When I tell artists that a new painting by a newish artist should go for around $1,200, they look at me like I\'m a flesh-eating virus.", Art
"To engage with art, we have to be willing to be wrong, venture outside our psychic comfort zones, suspend disbelief, and remember that art explores and alters consciousness simultaneously.", Art
"While a large segment of the art world has obsessed over a tiny number of stars and their prices, an aesthetic shift has been occurring. It\'s not a movement - movements are more sure of themselves. It\'s a change of mood or expectation, a desire for art to be more than showy effects, big numbers, and gamesmanship.", Art
"Wisdom is nothing but a preparation of the soul, a capacity, a secret art of thinking, feeling and breathing thoughts of unity at every moment of life.", Art
"Art is the signature of civilizations.", Art
"Art allows people a way to dream their way out of their struggle.", Art
"I am still a victim of chess. It has all the beauty of art - and much more. It cannot be commercialized. Chess is much purer than art in its social position.", Art
"Customs and convictions change; respectable people are the last to know, or to admit, the change, and the ones most offended by fresh reflections of the facts in the mirror of art.", Art
"The screen is a magic medium. It has such power that it can retain interest as it conveys emotions and moods that no other art form can hope to tackle.", Art
"Art is anything people do with distinction.", Art
"People of art should never get married and have children, because it\'s a selfish experience.", Art
"The downfall of the industry seems to actually be good for art. I think the industry will find their way once the focus shifts from its greed-based origins, downsizes, and begins to support creative visions that speak to our times and shifting ideals.", Art
"The condition every art requires is, not so much freedom from restriction, as freedom from adulteration and from the intrusion of foreign matter.", Art
"Nothing is as dangerous in architecture as dealing with separated problems. If we split life into separated problems we split the possibilities to make good building art.", Art
"Politeness is the art of choosing among your thoughts.", Art
"A man is a poet if difficulties inherent in his art provide him with ideas; he is not a poet if they deprive him of ideas.", Art
"Teaching is not a lost art, but the regard for it is a lost tradition.", Art
"In art economy is always beauty.", Art
"Admiration for a quality or an art can be so strong that it deters us from striving to possess it.", Art
"The art of acting consists in keeping people from coughing.", Art
"For art to exist, for any sort of aesthetic activity to exist, a certain physiological precondition is indispensable: intoxication.", Art
"Homer has taught all other poets the art of telling lies skillfully.", Art
"It is Homer who has chiefly taught other poets the art of telling lies skillfully.", Art
"Diplomacy is the art of saying \'Nice doggie\' until you can find a rock.", Art

"When art dresses in worn-out material it is most easily recognized as art.", Art
"Art raises its head where creeds relax.", Art
"I think in art, but especially in films, people are trying to confirm their own existences.", Art
"A work of art is above all an adventure of the mind.", Art
"Well, Art is Art, isn\'t it? Still, on the other hand, water is water. And east is east and west is west and if you take cranberries and stew them like applesauce they taste much more like prunes than rhubarb does. Now you tell me what you know.", Art
"Every art and every inquiry, and similarly every action and choice, is thought to aim at some good; and for this reason the good has rightly been declared to be that at which all things aim.", Art
"Politics is the art of controlling your environment.", Art
"Envy is the art of counting the other fellow\'s blessings instead of your own.", Art
"I do not know what the spirit of a philosopher could more wish to be than a good dancer. For the dance is his ideal, also his fine art, finally also the only kind of piety he knows, his \'divine service.\'", Art
"Art is not merely an imitation of the reality of nature, but in truth a metaphysical supplement to the reality of nature, placed alongside thereof for its conquest.", Art
"Were I called on to define, very briefly, the term Art, I should call it \'the reproduction of what the Senses perceive in Nature through the veil of the soul.\' The mere imitation, however accurate, of what is in Nature, entitles no man to the sacred name of \'Artist.\'", Art
"Take care to sell your horse before he dies. The art of life is passing losses on.", Art
"You use a glass mirror to see your face; you use works of art to see your soul.", Art
"Art is never finished, only abandoned.", Art
"She had lost the art of conversation but not, unfortunately, the power of speech.", Art

"Art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life.", Art
"The art of medicine consists in amusing the patient while nature cures the disease.", Art
"It is the function of art to renew our perception. What we are familiar with we cease to see. The writer shakes up the familiar scene, and, as if by magic, we see a new meaning in it.", Art
"Rhetoric is the art of ruling the minds of men.", Art
"Art is a lie that makes us realize truth.", Art
"The art of acceptance is the art of making someone who has just done you a small favor wish that he might have done you a greater one.", Art
"Politics is the art of looking for trouble, finding it everywhere, diagnosing it incorrectly and applying the wrong remedies.", Art
"Those who educate children well are more to be honored than they who produce them; for these only gave them life, those the art of living well.", Art
"I regard the theatre as the greatest of all art forms, the most immediate way in which a human being can share with another the sense of what it is to be a human being.", Art
"Excellence is an art won by training and habituation. We do not act rightly because we have virtue or excellence, but we rather have those because we have acted rightly. We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act but a habit.", Art
"There\'s no art to find the mind\'s construction in the face.", Art

"You must not fight too often with one enemy, or you will teach him all your art of war.", Art
"We\'re going to shoot one Polaroid per show. I\'m going to sign this before it even develops because I know that once it develops with my signature on it, it\'s worth a fortune. I\'ll make this a work of magic warlock art.", Art

"Freedom in art, freedom in society, this is the double goal towards which all consistent and logical minds must strive.", Art
"We all know that Art is not truth. Art is a lie that makes us realize the truth, at least the truth that is given to us to understand.", Art
"To array a man\'s will against his sickness is the supreme art of medicine.", Art
"The people who make art their business are mostly imposters.", Art
"I think art is the only thing that\'s spiritual in the world. And I refuse to forced to believe in other people\'s interpretations of God. I don\'t think anybody should be. No one person can own the copyright to what God means.", Art
"Surely all art is the result of one\'s having been in danger, of having gone through an experience all the way to the end, where no one can go any further.", Art
"What is Art? It is the response of man\'s creative soul to the call of the Real.", Art
"Sculpture is the art of the intelligence.", Art
"No great art has ever been made without the artist having known danger.", Art
"The capacity to be puzzled is the premise of all creation, be it in art or in science.", Art
"In Art, man reveals himself and not his objects.", Art
"Perhaps it\'s good for one to suffer. Can an artist do anything if he\'s happy? Would he ever want to do anything? What is art, after all, but a protest against the horrible inclemency of life?", Art
"Europe is so well gardened that it resembles a work of art, a scientific theory, a neat metaphysical system. Man has re-created Europe in his own image.", Art
"I am a soul. I know well that what I shall render up to the grave is not myself. That which is myself will go elsewhere. Earth, thou art not my abyss!", Art

"Logic: The art of thinking and reasoning in strict accordance with the limitations and incapacities of the human misunderstanding.", Art
"The art of living well and the art of dying well are one.", Art
"The finest works of art are precious, among other reasons, because they make it possible for us to know, if only imperfectly and for a little while, what it actually feels like to think subtly and feel nobly.", Art
"He who would do good to another must do it in Minute Particulars: general Good is the plea of the scoundrel, hypocrite, and flatterer, for Art and Science cannot exist but in minutely organized Particulars.", Art
"The person who knows one thing and does it better than anyone else, even if it only be the art of raising lentils, receives the crown he merits. If he raises all his energy to that end, he is a benefactor of mankind and its rewarded as such.", Art
"Life doesn\'t imitate art, it imitates bad television.", Art
"Only through art can we emerge from ourselves and know what another person sees.", Art
"In a decaying society, art, if it is truthful, must also reflect decay. And unless it wants to break faith with its social function, art must show the world as changeable. And help to change it.", Art
"Chance gives rise to thoughts, and chance removes them; no art can keep or acquire them.", Art
"There are no contests in the Art of Peace. A true warrior is invincible because he or she contests with nothing. Defeat means to defeat the mind of contention that we harbor within.", Art
"Mild autism can give you a genius like Einstein. If you have severe autism, you could remain nonverbal. You don\'t want people to be on the severe end of the spectrum. But if you got rid of all the autism genetics, you wouldn\'t have science or art. All you would have is a bunch of social \'yak yaks.\'", Art

"To be able to endure odium is the first art to be learned by those who aspire to power.", Art
"If thou art a man, admire those who attempt great things, even though they fail.", Art
"What I dream of is an art of balance, of purity and serenity devoid of troubling or depressing subject matter - a soothing, calming influence on the mind, rather like a good armchair which provides relaxation from physical fatigue.", Art
"The art of life is to live in the present moment, and to make that moment as perfect as we can by the realization that we are the instruments and expression of God Himself.", Art
"Passion is universal humanity. Without it religion, history, romance and art would be useless.", Art

"What garlic is to salad, insanity is to art.", Art
"When I am finishing a picture, I hold some God-made object up to it - a rock, a flower, the branch of a tree or my hand - as a final test. If the painting stands up beside a thing man cannot make, the painting is authentic. If there\'s a clash between the two, it\'s bad art.", Art
"I don\'t have anything to say about other people\'s art and their work.", Art
"What I\'ve discovered is that in art, as in music, there\'s a lot of truth-and then there\'s a lie.

"The worst part of success is to try finding someone who is happy for you.", Success

"The gifts of nature are infinite in their variety, and mind differs from mind almost as much as body from body.", Nature
"If religion had a good purpose, then man would have created something great. But we\'re man: we mess up everything. We mess up nature. We mess up God. We take what is given to us and make it into what we think it should be.", Nature
"Listen, if there\'s one sure-fire rule that I have learned in this business, it\'s that I don\'t know anything about human nature.", Nature

That is the American character. That is one of the things that makes us different from the rest of the world. And I\'m afraid we could lose that or are on the verge of losing that.", Nature

"Parents of recovered children, and I\'ve met hundreds, all share the same experience of doubters and deniers telling us our child must have never even had autism or that the recovery was simply nature\'s course.

"To say to the painter that Nature is to be taken as she is, is to say to the player that he may sit on the piano.", Nature
"Since those who believe they need a hero/celebrity outnumber the actual heroes/celebrities, people feel safe and comfortably justified in numbers, committing egregious crimes in the name of the greater social ego. Ironically diminishing their own true hero-celebrity nature in the process.", Nature

"My recollection of a hundred lovely lakes has given me blessed release from care and worry and the troubled thinking of our modern day. It has been a return to the primitive and the peaceful.", Nature
"A strong body makes the mind strong. As to the species of exercises, I advise the gun. While this gives moderate exercise to the body, it gives boldness, enterprise and independence to the mind.

"You know, people talk about this being an uncertain time. You know, all time is uncertain. I mean, it was uncertain back in - in 2007, we just didn\'t know it was uncertain. It was - uncertain on September 10th, 2001. It was uncertain on October 18th, 1987, you just didn\'t know it.", Time

"When people get married because they think it\'s a long-time love affair, they\'ll be divorced very soon, because all love affairs end in disappointment. But marriage is a recognition of a spiritual identity.", Love
"Don\'t do anything by half. If you love someone, love them with all your soul. When you go to work, work your ass off. When you hate someone, hate them until it hurts.", Love
"Flatter me, and I may not believe you. Criticize me, and I may not like you. Ignore me, and I may not forgive you. Encourage me, and I will not forget you. Love me and I may be forced to love you.", Love
"What do I care about the purring of one who cannot love, like the cat?", Love
"The wise are wise only because they love. The fool are fools only because they think they can understand love.", Love

"A scholar who cherishes the love of comfort is not fit to be deemed a scholar.", Love

"Love matches, so called, have illusion for their father and need for their mother.", Love
"You don\'t have to deserve your mother\'s love. You have to deserve your father\'s.", Love

"My friends and family are my support system. They tell me what I need to hear, not what I want to hear and they are there for me in the good and bad times. Without them I have no idea where I would be and I know that their love for me is what\'s keeping my head above the water.", Love

"I will love the light for it shows me the way, yet I will endure the darkness because it shows me the stars.", Love
"Anxiety is love\'s greatest killer. It makes others feel as you might when a drowning man holds on to you. You want to save him, but you know he will strangle you with his panic.", Love
"A poet never takes notes. You never take notes in a love affair.", Love

"The love of economy is the root of all virtue.", Love
"To love rightly is to love what is orderly and beautiful in an educated and disciplined way.", Love

"We are never so defensless against suffering as when we love.", Love
"There is no lonelier man in death, except the suicide, than that man who has lived many years with a good wife and then outlived her. If two people love each other there can be no happy end to it.", Love
"We always deceive ourselves twice about the people we love - first to their advantage, then to their disadvantage.", Love
"Hate is only a form love that hasn\'t found a way to express itself logically.", Love
"So much of what is best in us is bound up in our love of family, that it remains the measure of our stability because it measures our sense of loyalty. All other pacts of love or fear derive from it and are modeled upon it.", Love
"I\'m not saying that love always takes you to heaven. Your life can become a nightmare. But that said, it is worth taking the risk.", Love
"There is no scarcity of opportunity to make a living at what you love; there\'s only scarcity of resolve to make it happen.", Love

"We\'re not raising children with the love that we need to.", Love
"True love stories never have endings.", Love
"The most important thing in the world is family and love.", Love

"What I know is, is that if you do work that you love, and the work fulfills you, the rest will come.", Love
"Let love flow so that it cleanses the world. Then man can live in peace, instead of the state of turmoil he has created through his past ways of life, with all those material interests and earthly ambitions.", Love
"Passion is momentary; love is enduring.", Love
"It\'s tangible, it\'s solid, it\'s beautiful. It\'s artistic, from my standpoint, and I just love real estate.", Love
"Whoever loves becomes humble. Those who love have, so to speak, pawned a part of their narcissism.", Love
"May you live as long as you wish and love as long as you live.", Love
"Acceptance is not love. You love a person because he or she has lovable traits, but you accept everybody just because they\'re alive and human.", Love

"Behold, my friends, the spring is come; the earth has gladly received the embraces of the sun, and we shall soon see the results of their love!", Love
"Fantasy love is much better than reality love. Never doing it is very exciting. The most exciting attractions are between two opposites that never meet.", Love
"Girls we love for what they are; young men for what they promise to be.", Love
"It\'s not an act. I love it. It\'s totally original. People go, \'What\'s going on with this guy? Why does he sound so weird? What is going on in his brain. I don\'t know. Just one day I suddenly woke up with a new brain.", Love
"Love cannot endure indifference. It needs to be wanted. Like a lamp, it needs to be fed out of the oil of another\'s heart, or its flame burns low.", Love
"The more I think about it, the more I realize there is nothing more artistic than to love others.", Love
"Love is the ultimate theme, but it\'s not just for women.", Love
"If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners love those who love them. And if you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you? For even sinners do the same.", Love

"What I cannot love, I overlook. Is that real friendship?", Love
"There is something in the unselfish and self-sacrificing love of a brute, which goes directly to the heart of him who has had frequent occasion to test the paltry friendship and gossamer fidelity of mere Man.", Love
"I will not be just a tourist in the world of images, just watching images passing by which I cannot live in, make love to, possess as permanent sources of joy and ecstasy.", Love
"We do not judge the people we love.", Love
"I love it when someone insults me. That means that I don\'t have to be nice anymore.", Love
"The desire for possession is insatiable, to such a point that it can survive even love itself. To love, therefore, is to sterilize the person one loves.", Love
"I love you the more in that I believe you had liked me for my own sake and for nothing else.", Love
"We need to teach the next generation of children from day one that they are responsible for their lives. Mankind\'s greatest gift, also its greatest curse, is that we have free choice. We can make our choices built from love or from fear.", Love
"The opposite of love is not hate, it\'s indifference.", Love
"Absences are a good influence in love and keep it bright and delicate.", Love
"I love being black in America, and especially being black in Hollywood.", Love
"If you love someone, you say it, right then, out loud. Otherwise, the moment just passes you by.", Love
"If a person loves only one other person and is indifferent to all others, his love is not love but a symbiotic attachment, or an enlarged egotism.", Love
"Love seeks one thing only: the good of the one loved. It leaves all the other secondary effects to take care of themselves. Love, therefore, is its own reward.", Love
"Those who intend on becoming great should love neither themselves nor their own things, but only what is just, whether it happens to be done by themselves or others.", Love
"My parents shared not only an improbable love, they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation. They would give me an African name, Barack, or blessed, believing that in a tolerant America your name is no barrier to success.", Love
"Depression is when you have lots of love, but no one\'s taking.", Love
"Love and work... work and love, that\'s all there is.", Love
"I met in the street a very poor young man who was in love. His hat was old, his coat worn, his cloak was out at the elbows, the water passed through his shoes, - and the stars through his soul.", Love

"First and last, what is demanded of genius is love of truth.", Love

"Love can do much, but duty more.", Love
"Sir, my concern is not whether God is on our side; my greatest concern is to be on God\'s side, for God is always right.", God
"We need to find God, and he cannot be found in noise and restlessness. God is the friend of silence. See how nature - trees, flowers, grass- grows in silence; see the stars, the moon and the sun, how they move in silence... We need silence to be able to touch souls.", God
"When the solution is simple, God is answering.", God
"While I know myself as a creation of God, I am also obligated to realize and remember that everyone else and everything else are also God\'s creation.", God
"Never trust anyone completely but God. Love people, but put your full trust only in God.", God
"I believe God is managing affairs and that He doesn\'t need any advice from me. With God in charge, I believe everything will work out for the best in the end. So what is there to worry about.", God
"God and Nature first made us what we are, and then out of our own created genius we make ourselves what we want to be. Follow always that great law. Let the sky and God be our limit and Eternity our measurement.", God
"The best remedy for those who are afraid, lonely or unhappy is to go outside, somewhere where they can be quiet, alone with the heavens, nature and God. Because only then does one feel that all is as it should be.", God
"The Christian life is not a constant high. I have my moments of deep discouragement. I have to go to God in prayer with tears in my eyes, and say, \'O God, forgive me,\' or \'Help me.\'", God
"God is, even though the whole world deny him. Truth stands, even if there be no public support. It is self-sustained.", God
"Each one prays to God according to his own light.", God
"God, as Truth, has been for me a treasure beyond price. May He be so to every one of us.", God
"God will not permit any troubles to come upon us, unless He has a specific plan by which great blessing can come out of the difficulty.", God

"Laughter is God\'s blessing.", God
"When it is a question of God\'s almighty Spirit, never say, \'I can\'t.\'", God
"Whatever comes from God is impossible for a man to turn back.", God

"In life, you have people that love to party. That\'s me. People that love God. That\'s me. People that love sex. That\'s me. People that love people. That\'s me. And people that make mistakes.That\'s me also.", God
"It is one of the ironies of the ministry that the very man who works in God\'s name is often hardest put to find time for God. The parents of Jesus lost Him at church, and they were not the last ones to lose Him there.", God

"When I speak of natural drummers I\'m talking about guys that are playing with the talent God gave \'em.", God
"God\'s arrows of affliction are sharp and painful so He can get our attention. He won\'t let His beloved children get away with sin because He knows it robs us of blessings, opportunities, and even character refinement.", God

"God has given you one face, and you make yourself another.", God
"I believe in God, but not as one thing, not as an old man in the sky. I believe that what people call God is something in all of us. I believe that what Jesus and Mohammed and Buddha and all the rest said was right. It\'s just that the translations have gone wrong.", God
"Man is born passionate of body, but with an innate though secret tendency to the love of Good in his main-spring of Mind. But God help us all! It is at present a sad jar of atoms.", God

"When asked if I miss being in government, I usually try to lighten the moment by responding that I awake most days, read the paper, and then observe that, \'It\'s yet another great day to be the former director of the Central Intelligence Agency.\'", Intelligence
"There\'s this movie, \'Zero Dark Thirty\' about the hunt for Osama bin Laden. Some have complained that too many \'secrets\' were dished out by the intelligence and special operations communities to director Kathryn Bigelow, screenwriter Mark Boal and their crew, part of a broader pattern of using intelligence for political effect.", Intelligence
"When I was at the CIA I asked my civilian advisory board to tackle some tough questions. Among the toughest: In a political culture that every day demands more transparency and more public accountability from every aspect of national life, could American intelligence continue to survive and succeed? That jury is still out.", Intelligence
"So, you know, I think that Democrats are being more successful in Congress and I\'m really going to be proud of the role I will play tomorrow as ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee when this bill passes.", Intelligence
"A lot of the things that we\'ve been able to do in the last several years were Democratic ideas, including the structure for this new director of national intelligence.", Intelligence
"The Committee\'s review of a series of intelligence shortcomings, to include intelligence prior to 9/11 and the pre-war intelligence on Iraq, clearly reveal how vital a diverse intelligence workforce is to our national security.", Intelligence

"Undernourished, intelligence becomes like the bloated belly of a starving child: swollen, filled with nothing the body can use.", Intelligence
"If a cat does something, we call it instinct; if we do the same thing, for the same reason, we call it intelligence.", Intelligence
"I don\'t intend to simply go away and write my plays and be a good boy. I intend to remain an independent and political intelligence in my own right.", Intelligence
"They say military have the so-called \'secret intelligence\' - this amount of intelligence must be very secret, since I\'ve never seen any intelligent military person, nor I have seen any sense in the bloody stupid wars.", Intelligence
"It takes an extraordinary intelligence to contemplate the obvious.", Intelligence
"Intelligence is quickness to apprehend as distinct form ability, which is capacity to act wisely on the thing apprehended.", Intelligence

"The sad thing about artificial intelligence is that it lacks artifice and therefore intelligence.", Intelligence
"Kindness and intelligence don\'t always deliver us from the pitfalls and traps: there are always failures of love, of will, of imagination. There is no way to take the danger out of human relationships.", Intelligence
"Wisdom and deep intelligence require an honest appreciation of mystery.", Intelligence
"Newt Gingrich has a restless and outsized intelligence that is tragically unleavened by any kind of critical sensibility.", Intelligence
"Bill Gates wants people to think he\'s Edison, when he\'s really Rockefeller. Referring to Gates as the smartest man in America isn\'t right... wealth isn\'t the same thing as intelligence.", Intelligence
"I find intelligence sexy. I find a sense of humor sexy. I find sensitivity sexy.", Intelligence
"Foolishness is rarely a matter of lack of intelligence or even lack of information.", Intelligence
"Intelligence recognizes what has happened. Genius recognizes what will happen.", Intelligence
"But once you are in that field, emotional intelligence emerges as a much stronger predictor of who will be most successful, because it is how we handle ourselves in our relationships that determines how well we do once we are in a given job.", Intelligence
"Sensible and responsible women do not want to vote. The relative positions to be assumed by man and woman in the working out of our civilization were assigned long ago by a higher intelligence than ours.", Intelligence
"I don\'t deny that there are problems in the intelligence world, but I would argue that in the UK we try to uphold the highest standards in the world.", Intelligence
"Instinct perfected is a faculty of using and even constructing organized instruments; intelligence perfected is the faculty of making and using unorganized instruments.", Intelligence

"There is little evidence that our individual intelligence has improved through recorded history.", Intelligence
"Cynicism is the intellectual cripple\'s substitute for intelligence.", Intelligence
"Human folk are as a matter of fact eager to find intelligence in animals.", Intelligence

"The Secret Intelligence Service I knew occupied dusky suites of little rooms opposite St James\'s Park Tube station in London.", Intelligence
"The White House is giving George W. Bush intelligence briefings. You know, some of these jokes just write themselves.", Intelligence
"There are a lot of obstacles in the way of our understanding animal intelligence - not the least being that we can\'t even agree whether nonhuman species are conscious. We accept that chimps and dolphins experience awareness; we like to think dogs and cats do. But what about mice and newts? What about a fly? Is anything going on there at all?", Intelligence
"The assumption is that the right kind of society is an organic being not merely analogous to an organic being, but actually a living structure with appetites and digestions, instincts and passions, intelligence and reason.", Intelligence

"I now bid farewell to the country of my birth - of my passions - of my death; a country whose misfortunes have invoked my sympathies - whose factions I sought to quell - whose intelligence I prompted to a lofty aim - whose freedom has been my fatal dream.", Intelligence
"I want to exude strength and intelligence.", Intelligence
"From the lowest animals of which we can affirm intelligence up to man this type of intellect is found.", Intelligence
"I think that intelligence is such a narrow branch of the tree of life - this branch of primates we call humans. No other animal, by our definition, can be considered intelligent. So intelligence can\'t be all that important for survival, because there are so many animals that don\'t have what we call intelligence, and they\'re surviving just fine.", Intelligence
"I can remember when I was National Security Adviser, the intelligence community told us... they put out an intelligence report saying that Iran would never back off from attacks on shipping in the Gulf if we use force.", Intelligence
"And I argued with that intelligence estimate and I think it is a responsibility of policymakers to use their best judgment on the basis of the intelligence they\'ve received.", Intelligence

"An intelligence analyst may attribute an attack to al Qaeda, whereas a policy maker could opt for the more general \'extremist.\'", Intelligence
"I certainly believe that improving our intelligence is of important national interest.", Intelligence
"Intelligence is our first line of defense against terrorism, and we must improve the collection capabilities and analysis of intelligence to protect the security of the United States and its allies.", Intelligence
"Mr. Speaker, we are a blessed Nation. We have not suffered another attack on our soil since September 11, and we are grateful. We have killed or captured dozens of members of al Qaeda and the Taliban. Our military and intelligence forces are working both hard and smart.", Intelligence
"We\'re not trying to harass the average American. We need to convert this now to a risk-based system, with TSA concentrating and focusing on intelligence, on security, setting up again the parameters of which we do this.", Intelligence
"The fact is that a car used by Gerry Adams and myself during the course of the Mitchell review was bugged by elements within British military intelligence.", Intelligence
"I consider myself a spiritual atheist. I certainly believe there are forces bigger than ourselves, and that we should be searching, individually, for meaning in our lives. But I don\'t believe there\'s a supreme being, an intelligence that created everything.", Intelligence
"So that, to me, is important that audiences are treated with an amount of respect toward their intelligence. Most Hollywood films don\'t respect their intelligence.", Intelligence
"There\'s a lot of neuroscience now raising the question, \'Is all the intelligence in the human body in the brain?\', and they\'re finding out that, no, it\'s not like that. The body has intelligence itself, and we\'re much more of an organic creature in that way.", Intelligence
"In Spain, we should have enough intelligence, enough sense of individual and collective responsibility to do for ourselves that which would be imposed upon us by a dictatorship.", Intelligence
"The accidental causes of science are only accidents relatively to the intelligence of a man.", Intelligence
"The intelligence community, for the most part, has no accountability at all; to the Congress, to us the American people, and so they feel that they above the law.", Intelligence

"The heartbeat of a football team is the quarterback position and I think everyone who has any intelligence about the game understands you must have consistency at that position to be a championship team.", Intelligence
"The hijab, or sikh turban, or Jewish skullcap are all explicit symbols, but they do not represent a threat or affront to others, and have no bearing on the competence, skills and intelligence of a person.", Intelligence
"I\'ve gotten to go wonderful places, meet interesting and intelligent people, and I started of course in the theatre and continue to work in the theatre where there is some intelligence involved in it.", Intelligence
"If you imagine someone with 100 percent determination and 100 percent intelligence, you can discard a lot of intelligence before they stop succeeding. But if you start discarding determination, you very quickly get an ineffectual and perpetual grad student.", Intelligence
"The key to artificial intelligence has always been the representation.", Intelligence
"Prediction is not just one of the things your brain does. It is the primary function of the neo-cortex, and the foundation of intelligence.", Intelligence
"If they had said my writing wasn\'t good enough, fair enough, that\'s an opinion. But to say it\'s too complex is to insult the intelligence of the so-called young.", Intelligence
"The \'Robben Island Bible\' has arrived at the British Museum. It\'s a garish thing, its cover plastered with pink and gold Hindu images, designed to hide its contents. Within is the finest collection of words generated by human intelligence: the complete works of William Shakespeare.", Intelligence
"The 9/11 Commission strongly recommends that the National Intelligence Director be fully in control of the budget, from developing it to implementing it, to ensuring that the National Intelligence Director has the clout to make decisions.", Intelligence
"The National Intelligence Director needs the authority to do the job we are asking him to do. That means power over the intelligence budget. And to be effective, to be allowed to do his or her job, they must have authority over the budget.", Intelligence
"The intelligence investigation under the leadership of Senator Church, which I know has helped cause this investigation by you, points out that the agencies did not disclose certain facts to us and that certain plots were going on.", Intelligence
"The Queen\'s intelligence network is a hell of a lot better than anyone\'s in this palace. Bar none. She knows everything. I don\'t know how she does it. And she sees everything.", Intelligence
"I try to put all I am as a person into what I do. My intelligence, my emotion. I\'ve done that in everything.", Intelligence
"Nothing is more important to national security and the making and conduct of good policy than timely, accurate, and relevant intelligence. Nothing is more critical to accurate and relevant intelligence than independent analysis.", Intelligence
"All officers of the Intelligence Community, and especially its most senior officer, must conduct themselves in a manner that earns and retains the public trust. The American people are uncomfortable with government activities that do not take place in the open, subject to public scrutiny and review.", Intelligence
"Before 9/11 there were weak procedures, willingness, and mechanisms for communicating among agencies for foreign intelligence and the FBI with its focus on law enforcement. The domestic-vs.-foreign barrier has been solved by the reforms after 9/11 that established the DNI.", Intelligence
"I mean enormous pressure was brought to bear - Valerie Amos, Lady Amos, went round Africa with people from our intelligence services trying to press them. I had to make sure that we didn\'t promise a misuse of aid in a way that would be illegal.", Intelligence
"I feel audiences are not given enough credit for their intelligence.", Intelligence
"We have been working hard to think about what our combined needs are going to be in the way of intelligence capabilities, not today but 15 to 20 years in the future.", Intelligence
"Over the course of two years, we arrived at a point where we began to look at the value added by making information more easily accessible across the intelligence community, both defense and national.", Intelligence
"One is to ensure that the war fighters and the intelligence analysts get the information that they need when they need it, in a format that\'s useful to them.", Intelligence
"But by providing the background picture - the universal situational awareness that we desire - by showing the anomalies, the Space-Based Radar will change the nature of how we do our analysis and our intelligence.", Intelligence
"When a decision is made to go to war based on intelligence, it is a fateful decision. It has ramifications and impacts way beyond the current months and years.", Intelligence
"Dr. Rice\'s record on Iraq gives me great concern. In her public statements she clearly overstated and exaggerated the intelligence concerning Iraq before the war in order to support the President\'s decision to initiate military action against Iraq.", Intelligence
"When we see animals doing remarkable things, how do we know if we\'re simply seeing tricks or signs of real intelligence? Are talented animals just obeying commands, or do they have some kind of deeper understanding? One of the biggest challenges for animal researchers is to come up with tests that can distinguish between the two.", Intelligence
"It was my mother\'s idea. Her feeling was that I didn\'t have the intelligence to pick a trade myself.", Intelligence
"Emotional intelligence begins to develop in the earliest years. All the small exchanges children have with their parents, teachers, and with each other carry emotional messages.", Intelligence
"Of course it is a very simple matter to identify genes which might modify intelligence or memory and start thinking about whether you want to enhance a human, and the next generation is going to have to deal with that issue. Should we be trying to enhance humans rather than trying to educate them and so on?", Intelligence
"An organization\'s intelligence is distributed to the point of being ubiquitous.", Intelligence
"If you look at military and intelligence positions from the 1950s, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has always been against American national interests.", Intelligence

"Most good actors have a huge intelligence about the human condition and a real open heart to different kinds of people and behavior.", Intelligence
"If you wish to spare yourself and your venerable family, give heed to my advice with the ear of intelligence. If you do not, you will see what God has willed.", Intelligence
"I think there\'s a supreme power behind the whole thing, an intelligence. Look at all of the instincts of nature, both animals and plants, the very ingenious ways they survive. If you cut yourself, you don\'t have to think about it.", Intelligence
"While the intelligence profession oftentimes demands secrecy, it is critically important that there be a full and open discourse on intelligence matters with the appropriate elected representatives of the American people.", Intelligence
"The higher the general average of intelligence, all things else being equal, the less the disposition to be meddlesome, critical, and overbearing.", Intelligence
"Hamlet is an astonishing intelligence.", Intelligence
"We are in this business, whether it be intelligence or the government, to protect freedom, democracy and liberty, not to violate that.", Intelligence
"It is only when you watch the dense mass of thousands of ants, crowded together around the Hill, blackening the ground, that you begin to see the whole beast, and now you observe it thinking, planning, calculating. It is an intelligence, a kind of live computer, with crawling bits for its wits.", Intelligence
"Science is the highest personification of the nation because that nation will remain the first which carries the furthest the works of thought and intelligence.", Intelligence
"Well, I think there\'s a distinction between sexing-up the intelligence and sexing-up the presentation of the intelligence.", Intelligence
"Humans have always used our intelligence and creativity to improve our existence. After all, we invented the wheel, discovered how to make fire, invented the printing press and found a vaccine for polio.", Intelligence
"A John Updike is a once-in-a-generation phenomenon, if that generation is lucky: so comfortable in so many genres, the same lively, generous intelligence suffusing all he did.", Intelligence
"You know, as director of the CIA, I got an awful lot of intelligence about all the horrible things that could go on across the world.", Intelligence
"We will have to continue to improve our human intelligence system-something that was, unfortunately, lacking in the years which led up to September 11. This is going to be a continuing process of change.", Intelligence
"When I went on to write my next book, Working With Emotional Intelligence, I wanted to make a business case that the best performers were those people strong in these skills.", Intelligence
"The ability to take pleasure in one\'s life is a skill and is a kind of intelligence. So intelligence is a hard thing to evaluate and it manifests itself in so many different ways. I do think the ability to know how to live a life and not be miserable is a sign of that.", Intelligence
"By the 2030s, the nonbiological portion of our intelligence will predominate.", Intelligence
"It takes intelligence to make real comedy, and it takes a reality base to create all that little stuff I like to do that makes you giggle inside.", Intelligence
"All of the biggest technological inventions created by man - the airplane, the automobile, the computer - says little about his intelligence, but speaks volumes about his laziness.", Intelligence
"The question that will decide our destiny is not whether we shall expand into space. It is: shall we be one species or a million? A million species will not exhaust the ecological niches that are awaiting the arrival of intelligence.", Intelligence
"God does not require you to follow His leadings on blind trust. Behold the evidence of an invisible intelligence pervading everything, even your own mind and body.", Intelligence
"Christianity taught men that love is worth more than intelligence.", Intelligence
"I have great faith in the intelligence of the American viewer and reader to put two and two together and come up with four.", Intelligence
"I\'ve always wanted to be a spy, and frankly I\'m a little surprised that British intelligence has never approached me.", Intelligence
"She saw too that man has the power of exceeding himself, of becoming himself more entirely and profoundly than he is, truths which have only recently begun to be seen in Europe and seem even now too great for its common intelligence.", Intelligence
"So many people say that obviously my game has changed since I arrived here and I say that it\'s good that it changed, otherwise it would show a lack of intelligence.", Intelligence
"Perhaps measuring animal intelligence by comparing it to human intelligence isn\'t the best litmus test.", Intelligence
"Intelligence is the faculty of making artificial objects, especially tools to make tools.", Intelligence
"In Europe they call geeks \'smart people,\' and frankly I think we live in a culture that doesn\'t value intelligence enough; so I am very proud in saying that I am a geek.", Intelligence
"I absolutely don\'t think a sentient artificial intelligence is going to wage war against the human species.", Intelligence
"We need to make a greater investment in human intelligence.", Intelligence
"It is an accepted commonplace in psychology that the spiritual level of people acting as a crowd is far lower than the mean of each individual\'s intelligence or morality.", Intelligence
"The intelligence community gets hurt through sequestration.", Intelligence
"I do not - I never believed it\'s better to kill a terrorist than to detain him. We want to detain as many terrorists as possible so we can elicit the intelligence from them in the appropriate manner so that we can disrupt follow-on terrorist attacks.", Intelligence
"The actions that we take on the counterterrorism front, again, are to take actions against individuals where we believe that the intelligence base is so strong and the nature of the threat is so grave and serious, as well as imminent, that we have no recourse except to take this action that may involve a lethal strike.", Intelligence
"I will not, nor will I ever, publicly divulge sensitive intelligence sources and methods. For when that happens, our national security is endangered and lives can be lost.", Intelligence
"As a former career intelligence professional, I have a profound appreciation for the value of intelligence. Intelligence disrupts terrorist plots and thwarts attacks. Intelligence saves lives.", Intelligence
"Simply stated, the need for accurate intelligence and prescient analysis from CIA has never been greater than it is in 2013 - or than it will be in the coming years.", Intelligence
"We will use all lawful tools at our disposal, and that includes authorities under the renewed PATRIOT Act. We firmly believe that our intelligence gathering tools must enable us to collect the information we need to protect the American people.", Intelligence
"Well, first of all, we did lots of studies where we show practical intelligence doesn\'t correlate with G. We have probably two dozen studies that practical intelligence better predicts job success than IQ.", Intelligence
"Without consciousness and intelligence, the universe would lack meaning.", Intelligence
"I did my military service from 1989 - 92 and I was never shot at or had to fire on anybody. I was very lucky. I was more involved in intelligence and counter-intelligence.", Intelligence
"The security of the United States, which is so dependent on having accurate and timely intelligence, is not a Republican or a Democratic issue.", Intelligence
"One of the great intellectual failures of the American intelligence community, and especially the counterterrorism community, is to assume if someone hasn\'t attacked us, it\'s because he can\'t or because we\'ve defeated him.", Intelligence
"I\'m much better informed than Mr. Clarke ever was about the nature of the intelligence that was available again Osama bin Laden and which was consistently denigrated by himself and Mr. Tenet.", Intelligence

"The Intelligence Committee will also examine present counterintelligence programs for the Department of Energy, the National Laboratories, and the Department of Defense.", Intelligence
"Despite our very recent appearance on the planet, humanity combines arrogance with increasing material demands, even as we become more numerous. Our toughness is a delusion. Have we the intelligence and discipline to vigilantly guard against our tendency to grow without limit?", Intelligence
"I need to add that my work on multiple intelligences received a huge boost in 1995 when Daniel Goleman published his book on emotional intelligence. I am often confused with Dan. Initially, though Dan and I are longtime friends, this confusion irritated me.", Intelligence
"We\'ve done it in intelligence sharing and certain elements of security. There were parts of the department, in fact, that worked very well in Katrina, like the Coast Guard and TSA.", Intelligence
"They have involved co-operation between the Iraqi intelligence and al-Qaeda operatives on training and combined operations regarding bomb making and chemical and biological weapons.", Intelligence
"The intelligence of the lower forms of animal life, like a great deal of human intelligence, does not involve a self.", Intelligence
"My work requires acting at its most committed - it demands actors of enormous resilience, but also intelligence and wit. It doesn\'t work for narcissistic or selfish actors.", Intelligence
"If the presence of electricity can be made visible in any part of the circuit, I see no reason why intelligence may not be transmitted instantaneously by electricity.", Intelligence
"There is no one, who possesses intelligence and uses reflection, who does not understand that it is one Being who both created all things and governs them with the same energy by which He created them.", Intelligence
"As liberty and intelligence have increased the people have more and more revolted against the theological dogmas that contradict common sense and wound the tenderest sensibilities of the soul.", Intelligence
"But every time our ability to access information and to communicate it to others is improved, in some sense we have achieved an increase over natural intelligence.", Intelligence
"I am suggesting that we recognize that in network and interface research there is something as profound (and potential wild) as Artificial Intelligence.", Intelligence
"In November, they transferred control of Abu Ghraib to the military intelligence command completely; it was, after all, the center for interrogations for Iraq.", Intelligence
"The day after the prison was transferred to the military intelligence command, they had an entire battalion - 1,200, 1,500 soldiers - arrive at Abu Ghraib just for force protection alone.", Intelligence
"Military intelligence interrogators, however, their goal is to get information, to save lives, to stop the war, to find Saddam - whatever the information is going to be used for, at whatever cost.", Intelligence
"The great corporations of this country were not founded by ordinary people. They were founded by people with extraordinary intelligence, ambition, and aggressiveness.", Intelligence
"Women have talent and intelligence but, due to social constraints and prejudices, it is still a long distance away from the goal of gender equality.", Intelligence
"Man has made use of his intelligence, he invented stupidity.", Intelligence
"The 21st century - and the atheists - needs the presence of religion, just as religion must deal with the real challenges and the thinkers of the day in order to sharpen the conscience and the intelligence of those who study the timeless sacred texts in a spirit of responding to the questions of their time.", Intelligence
"Cultures are never merely intellectual constructs. They take form through the collective intelligence and memory, through a commonly held psychology and emotions, through spiritual and artistic communion.", Intelligence
"Well look, CIA is an agency that has to collect intelligence, do operations. We have to take risks and it\'s important that we take risks and that we know that we have the support of the government and we have the support of the American people in what we\'re doing.", Intelligence
"I know from my own experience that there is much more to \'intelligence\' than an IQ number. In fact, I hesitate to believe that any system could really reflect the complexity and uniqueness of one person\'s mind, or meaningfully describe the nature of his or her potential.", Intelligence
"I can\'t see what\'s wrong about assuming intelligence in your audience and what\'s bad news about being rewarded for assuming that.", Intelligence
"We know that there are unaccounted-for Scud and other ballistic missiles in Iraq. And part of the problem is that, since 1998, there has been no way to even get minimal information about those programs except through intelligence means.", Intelligence
"It is difficult, if not impossible, to argue that laws written in the 1970s are adequate for today\'s intelligence challenges.", Intelligence
"I\'ve never met a person who has more integrity than my husband. I respect that. There\'s his humor and intelligence, too, and he\'s really cute, all those things - but if you don\'t respect your partner, you\'ll get sick of him.", Intelligence
"A great many people think that polysyllables are a sign of intelligence.", Intelligence
"The war on terror, I believe, will be waged by effective intelligence and police work and cruise missiles.", Intelligence

"I\'ve always felt, in all my books, that there\'s a deep decency in the American people and a native intelligence - providing they have the facts, providing they have the information.", Intelligence
"I don\'t know how to depict intelligence.", Intelligence
"To attempt to superimpose its views through the exercise of force, is seldom the part of intelligence; it is frequently the part of ignorance.", Intelligence
"I think that animals aren\'t less intelligent than humans, they\'re just of a different intelligence. We have five million smell-sensitive cells in our nose, they have two hundred and fifty million - they can smell emotion. They can smell different types of emotion, they just have another type of intelligence.", Intelligence
"Improving our national intelligence capabilities should remain a top priority and a continual process.", Intelligence
"Since September 11th Congress has created the Department of Homeland Security, more than doubled the homeland security budget and implemented a bipartisan overhaul of our intelligence systems.", Intelligence
"There is huge demand for artificial intelligence technologies.", Intelligence
"Many difficulties which nature throws in our way, may be smoothed away by the exercise of intelligence.", Intelligence
"My father ran London Films. He made films like \'The Red Shoes,\' \'The Third Man.\' And he had had a long career in the film business, which was bifurcated with a career in intelligence. He had to deal with gangsters, and sometimes he would take me with him. Also, I went to school with their children.", Intelligence

"But it has, in addition, an even more precious quality - a consciousness of the human intelligence, the human spirit and that man is a social creature.", Intelligence
"God gives us intelligence to uncover the wonders of nature. Without the gift, nothing is possible.", Intelligence
"But it is equally incontrovertible that if our intelligence gathering process is seriously flawed, we had better find out and find out fast if we are to avoid another Sept. 11.", Intelligence

"I began even as a boy to realize how wide the world can be for a man of free intelligence.", Intelligence
"The Patriot Act removed major legal barriers that prevented the law enforcement, intelligence, and national defense communities from talking and coordinating their work to protect the American people and our national security.", Intelligence
"I also believe that it is time to begin the fundamental analysis of how we got here, what led us here and what we need to do in order to ensure that we are equipped with the best possible intelligence as we face these issues in the future.", Intelligence
"Policymakers have to make judgments based on the best intelligence they get.", Intelligence
"Terrorists continue to exploit divisions between law enforcement and the intelligence communities that limit the sharing of vital counterterrorism information.", Intelligence
"We ought to recognize that we have an offensive responsibility to take the war to the terrorists where they are. That responsibility has waned in the last year as military and intelligence resources were withdrawn from Afghanistan and Pakistan to be used in Iraq.", Intelligence
"During the Cold War, we gathered information by listening to the Soviets, taking pictures of the Soviets, and we allowed our human intelligence to decline.", Intelligence
"This president has been reluctant to hold anybody accountable. No one was held accountable after September the 11th. Nobody\'s been held accountable after the clear flaws in intelligence leading up to the war in Iraq.", Intelligence
"I refuse to be molded into some stereotypical ballplayer that has no interests, really, no life, no depth, no intelligence.", Intelligence
"People have an image of Italians. When I go somewhere in the world, I don\'t care where it is, when they look at me it\'s not about my intelligence. It\'s who can I beat up.", Intelligence
"Look, people have an image of Italians. When I go somewhere in the world, I don\'t care where it is, when they look at me it\'s not about my intelligence. It\'s who can I beat up.", Intelligence
"The E.U. has moved to combat global terrorism by instituting common European arrest and evidence warrants and creating a joint situation center to pool and analyze intelligence.", Intelligence

"Legislation passed in the aftermath of September 11, 2001 enhanced our intelligence capabilities and strengthened our national defense, but until now our nation\'s immigration policies have not adapted to the needs of a post-September 11th world.", Intelligence
"Reputation is favorable notoriety as distinguished from fame, which is permanent approval of great deeds and noble thoughts by the best intelligence of mankind.", Intelligence
"I mean, we must act with intelligence. We must work on this framework, so that immigration becomes an asset to both nations. Believe me, what - just the Mayor Bloomberg said here in New York, that this city would be stopped, totally stopped if it were not by the immigrants working here.", Intelligence
