@attribute 'Got this yesterday and like it, had before. Just to note, PowerShot A2500 is an entry-level pocket camera which is very similar to PowerShot A2300: 16-megapixel 1/2.3\" sensor, DiGiC 4 processor, and 5x zoom 28mm wide angle lens, 2.7\" LCD. Even 720p HD video capabilities are the same.Pros:1. What really distinguishes it from its predecessor is Smart Auto Mode recognizing 32 shooting environments and adjusts settings for better quality. It automatically selects the best shooting settings for optimal quality based on the environmental factors (lightning I guess) to provide point\'n\'shoot simplicity.2. 16.0 Megapixels, with loads of resolution pictures are still clear. High resolution is also good for producing biggest printouts.3. 5x Optical Zoom is sufficient in most cases.4. DIGIC 4 Image Processor. Not as fast as DIGIC 5 though fast and powerful enough to give you advanced system options, provide quick-shoot with reliable performance and low battery consumption. As far as I know DIGIC 4 is currently Canon\'s most efficient processor for budget cameras. BTW it has some Eco mode, that is said to be providing even faster warm-up times and saves the standard battery, but I haven\'t tested it yet.5. Very lightweight, just put it into your pocket, can take it everywhere.6. Price tag - $99. You can\'t get any better camera for the price.Cons:1. Like A2300 it lacks optical image stabilization, though it\'s got digital image stabilization.2. 1/2.3\" sensor. Well, entry level CCD providing good pictures, not of a DSLR quality, that\'s all I can say.Summary:Sure this is not the best camera in the world. I definitely knew it when I bought the camera. BUT, I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of pictures I shot.If you\'re like me (not a pro) and looking for a budget point-and-shoot camera taking family photos and events, mostly shoot in daylight or good lighting, I\'d definitely recommend it, taking into account its price tag of $99 - just about right.' string

'This is my 6th point and shoot (P&S) camera in 9 years, ranging in price from $200-$300. I have had 1 Bell & Howell, 3 Nikons and this is my 2nd Canon P&S camera. The last 2 P&S cameras I had I literally wore out by taking so many pictures. I bought this as a second camera for my husband (who doesn\'t usually take pictures) to use when he goes hunting with my son. I chose a Canon because I have a Canon DSLR and love it. I also wanted an inexpensive camera, because I thought it would sit on the shelf for most of the year. Of course it did not come with a memory card, as I have yet to buy any camera that does.To test this camera, after shooting indoors for a bit, I took it to the park. Luckily, what started out as a sunny day turned cloudy, allowing me to test the camera in different lighting. This is a typical low priced P&S camera.  Like all P&S cameras, this one performs best in bright, outdoor lighting. However, the ease of use and quality of pictures for the small price tag makes this a good buy. This is one of the better P&S cameras I have had.Although no instruction manual was in the box (other than the very basics), it was easy to figure out how to manually set this camera, which is a must for me. I liked the fact that it has a PROGRAM setting, which allows me to set a program manually. Even if I switch to another setting, it saves my manual settings, allowing me to switch back and forth between settings. That was great when I tested it, because the lighting went from sunny to cloudy and back again. I could easily switch from AUTO to LANDSCAPE to PROGRAM (my manually programmed settings) and back, depending on lighting and activity, all while holding my 6 month old. The pictures I took while holding my baby (who was trying to grab the camera) of my 4 other children who were riding a moving train turned out surprisingly good. I also manually adjusted the ISO to 1600 and took some shots while holding my squirming baby, and the pictures were not as noisy as I thought they would be.This is a great camera for the price. I would definitely recommend it for anyone, especially those who are ready to do some manual adjustments to get better pictures, but not ready to spend a lot of money. I am glad I bought this camera, and I am happy because I think I will actually use it more than I originally thought!',' positive'
'The camera takes excellent pictures and videos, the price... you can\'t go wrong. I just wish it came with a cable as well to transfer pictures to my PC, instead of having to remove the SD card. This does not come with a memory card, i bought a \"Transcend 16GB Class 10 SDHC Flash Memory Card (TS16GSDHC10E)\" together with this and it works well. The camera is very lightweight, and does not look nor feel as though it can withstand any small fall for shock impact, so be careful with it.Ok an edit to my review: I just tried taking pictures of the moon and venus phenomena (08-09-13) and i realized that this camera zoomed up to 16times! Not just up to x5! After x5 it kept going, x8...x10....x16! I got an awesome pic at x16 of the moon and the planet.',' positive'
'IT IS EASY TO USE AND THE QUALITY OF THE PICTURES IS AMAZING.  I DON\'T THINK THERE IS A BETTER CAMERA  IN THE PRICE RANGE OF THIS ONE.  JUST SPENT 12 DAYS IN ITALY AND TOOK OVER 1000 PHOTOS THAT ARE LIKE POST CARDS.',' positive'
'Bought this little camera at Wal-Mart for 99.00.  Very pleased as a amateur photographer just wanting the occasional picture to put on my computer.  Thanks to Canon.  They make good products.',' positive'
'This is my first digital camera and it\'s so easy even I can take great pictures. I especially like that I can take stills and videos with the same camera.  I highly recommend this camera.',' positive'
'As a long time Canon compact camera user my favorite new features on the A2500 are...The Canon PowerShot A2500 does not just stop at taking images but is rather adept at handling videos as well. It is capable of producing 720p HD files at the touch of a button. One of the thoughtful things about this camera is the inclusion of the movie button. You do not have to fidget about with all sorts of controls in order to get the video going. Rather you go back to that simple button and the rest is history.Another nice feature is that this product is newly minted with an ECO mode which is designed to reduce the power consumption on your camera.The Canon brand has made cameras its specialty and the Canon PowerShot A2500 holds true to type. This model brings out all the features that you would expect of a camera of its class but has the added advantage of making it easier for the consumer to access those features. In other words you get the best of both worlds with a great camera and easy usage.Verdict:There are no major surprises with the Canon PowerShot A2500. It is a great camera that does what it says on the box.If you are looking for the next model up check out the Canon SD330 as it has another level of features and quality.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B5HE3UU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00B5HE3UU&linkCode=as2&tag=stupisms-20',' positive'
'The best pocket camera on the market for the price! There are 3 different cameras by Cannon in this category, go with the A2500 for added overall quality for just a small increase in price! I had been looking at point & shoot cameras, reading all the specs. along with remarks by other customers for about 3 months. I got this for my wife for her birthday and she is very picky after going through 3 previous cameras unsuccessfully, she has been very happy with this one(finally)!',' positive'
'I bought this camera for my son for his 12th birthday because of the price and the fact that I have an older model Canon Powershot that I love.  I was disappointed when I received the camera.  It is very lightweight, to the point of feeling very cheap.  My son really liked it though, very easy to use.  The wrist strap that comes with the camera is not adjustable so it does not tighten on your wrist.  We were in a cave in Colorado three days after he received it and he was taking a picture and the camera slipped out of his hand and since the wrist strap was not tightened on his wrist, it fell to the rock floor and broke.  I called Canon to see about getting it repaired.  It was a minimum $89 plus shipping to and from.  The camera cost me $85 including shipping thru Amazon.  Obviously this was no one\'s fault but my son\'s (although obviously he did not intend to drop it) but I don\'t know why a reputable company like Canon would cut such a cheap corner on their wrist strap and not make it adjustable.  I called Amazon to see if by any chance they would let me purchase a new one a a reduced cost, not expecting them to let me, and understandably so.  The Amazon rep sent me a brand new camera with free shipping and even sent a pre-paid UPS label to return the broken camera.  I have always been so impressed with Amazon\'s customer service.  The camera is alright, takes good pictures, but definitely buy a better wrist strap for it.  But so grateful to Amazon for replacing this for us!',' positive'
'I have had other small digital cameras, but6 this one is much easier to use.  The buttons to turn it  ON/OFF are not tiny,.the Menu is clear. Everything is great about this tiny little camera.  The photos are very good.Evelyn',' positive'
'For the how much it is, it takes quality photos. I would recommend this camera to someone that like to point and shoot.',' positive'

'Perfect for the occasional photographer that want\'s a quality camera at a fair price.  Easy to use and to produce a quality photo.',' positive'
'I work in real estate and need a camera that is compact, simple and get\'s the job done. This is the camera!! Easy to adjust the settings and takes great pictures. Battery life is good. One thing, it doesn\'t come with a USB cable to sync to your computer. Easy fix, just take take the memory card and insert into your desktop or cpu. Or spend a few dollars to buy the cable on amazon.',' positive'

'A2500 replaced a more expensive Canon I got through Amex rewards. While traveling on the train or on the street in Manhattan I lost it.. It was very sleek and slippery LOL  Time went by, I found the need to have a camera beyong iphone, ipad. I ordered this camera and I am learning how to use it.What I have found is that I need to learn about: no blur, MACRO (close up) --for novices like me. I need  wide lens features and the ability to fade out unwanted subject in the background.. I have not learned how to use all the features. I have taken very nice shots and not so nice shots experimenting. I find that sharpness is something to be explored in the manual. I am sure Canon tries to keep cost down by not providing a printed out manual but I wanted one and I did the unthinkable:-- printed it out! put it in a three ring  binder! old school I guess! I can point and shoot as described in the product section of this listing. This camera is a nicely priced one and If I should get careless again only this time drive over it!, well it won\'t cost me an arm and a leg to replace!.. The manual consists of 109  pages! That means there is a lot to learn! I went to manual websites to see how much a manual would cost to buy. The manual service charges between $12.95 plus the shipping cost! and up.I had the typing paper and the ink so I printed it out!Hope this helps you! I am already researching another Canon digital 16 mega because I need close ups of moving animals! i.e. parrots! I would add I bought a .99cent cable UBS cord (reviewed) and two extra batteries from Clearmax and an extra battery recharger. The clearmax battery charges in one hour. The Canon battery that came with this camera charges in 21/2 hours. I bought a SD HC device/card 16GB.  Remember: the SDHC card DOES NOT come with the camera. I am going to get a case and more accessories for my camera. Hope this helps!  from a newbie',' positive'
'My daughter did some extensive research on digital cameras and decided to buy the Cannon PowerShot  A2500.  This was a Christmas gift for her dad.  Happy to say, he loved and he uses it everyday.  Great camera for the price.',' positive'
'This camera was the perfect fit for me.I don\'t know a whole lot about photography, but taking a class in highschool taught me a lot.I really like it because you can take action photographs with relatively little blur. Just set it to program and choose the settings that you think will make the picture look good, your intuition is probably better than the cameras. Turn on the grid, so that you can easily find the center of a photograph. I take a lot of outdoors pictures and I really like the way they turn out.',' positive'
'This is my third Canon camera I have had in the last fifteen years and I love them all.  They are simple to use and the pictures are beautiful.',' positive'
'This camera was a present for my 7 year old grandaughter. She loved it, therefore so do I. It made a terrific present for a young girl.',' positive'
'I own an SLR and if you\'re like me who just wants to take a picture of my daughters from time to time because they look so cute messy, drooling or just mesmerized by TV, then this is for you. high quality pic. I only have a 16gb card inside and it says i can store >3500 pics at max quality. I mean, do you really take that much before transferring to a drive? so cheap too. worth the money.',' positive'
'This is the second camera I\'ve received and love it. The first camera came without the charger in the box and no memory card which I was promised in my initial purchase.I have no problems with this camera and just downloaded the user\'s manual to learn all the different settings I need to know about. I\'ve got the time and date set, and I\'m ready to take birthday pictures this weekend as well as some things I\'m going to be selling on Craigslist.I would recommend this model of camera for anyone who just wants to \"click and shoot\".',' positive'
'We got this for my Dad for Christmas and he loves it.  It small enough to carry around and holds a lot of photos.  We bought him cords/adapters to hook directly to his iPad so no more messing with Kodak software/updates, etc.  So easy for him to use.',' positive'
'Got this for my daughter since it was relatively well priced but still a name-brand with all the features she needs (automatic still pics & video clips).  It\'s very easy to use.  Love the dedicated video record button.  The pictures come out great.It\'s a wonderful compact size and very light.  The only thing I\'d want changed on it is to have AA batteries.',' positive'
'I just got the camera today and I love it. It takes sharp pics and the auto mode is excellent. The one thing I noticed right away is how light it is. It doesn\'t feel as sturdy I I would like but that\'s just because of its light weight design.',' positive'
'I had this on my wish list for a couple of years. It was almost 200 at that time. I forgot it was there and never purchased it. I was looking for a camera to purchase for my  boyfriend as a gift and came across this. He absolutely loves it. The photographs are crisp and clear, and the stabilizer is the best I\'ve seen in any other point and shoot camera. I highly recommend this to everyone.',' positive'

'camera is great. I can\'t use it because amazon didn\'t send me the free disc & camera case. that was supposed to come with it. i didn\'t realize i had to add them to the cart. i thought they were automaticlly sent with the camera as they were advertized as free with purchase of the camera',' positive'
'I bought this as a gift for my thirteen-year-old nephew. He loves the camera, and his family does, too. His mom reports that it takes better pictures than her iPhone camera, so the parents borrow it often. He learned to use the features quickly and is very careful with it. The red color distinguishes it for him. I am pleased.',' positive'
'The camera is exactly what I wanted.  The only problem I had and it was my fault, It didn\'t come with memory. I had to purchase that extra, but still a great camera thanks',' positive'
'The only qualm is that the on and off button is too easily turned on, by accidentally bumping it or in the act of putting the camera away. If the button had been recessed a bit...it would be better! Otherwise it\'s great!  Lightweight, intuitive, and great images. Recommended',' positive'
'Great gift for young enthusiasts.  Easy and fun to use.  They carry it with them and take pictures of everything.',' positive'

'Bought this as a Christmas present for my husband - now wish I had one for myself.  Small camera with big picture ability.',' positive'
'The A2500 Canon PowerShot is a great camera for the price.  Some of the previous reviews caused me second thoughts, but the camera exceeded my expectations and has worked well.  The third party higher capacity battery 2-pack is really required and I have yet to recharge the first of the two after two weeks and over a hundred pix!',' positive'

Set this to the smallest picture size and you get, wait for it, OVER 9000 pictures!',' positive'
'Super huge fan of Canon. My children will be going on their first cruise this year and I thought it would be nice to get them each their own cameras to make the trip even more fun.

'I looked at every review and watched the video several times before purchasing. I needed a new camera and I wanted something that was super easy to use and nice and compact, this is really nice!!!!!I love it and it takes great pictures and videos.

'I got this camera as my old Powershot broke and I needed to replace it. This one is better. I love the fact it is lightweight and slimmer than my old one. I think it takes better pictures than the old camera. I also love the improved feature of just hitting a button to go into movie mode. So for the money it is a great deal and I am really enjoying taking pictures with this camera.',' positive'
'I\'m not much of a photographer.  I like to take pictures once in a while, and I want them to turn out well when I do.  I had a much more advanced digital camera for several years, and I could never quite get the hang of it.  Too many settings and options for me.This arrived earlier today, and the battery charged very quickly using the included charger.  I was able to use the camera immediately, and the photo quality was really quite good.  I took pictures in some different lighting, including one right in front of a window, and they all looked great.This might not be a camera for everyone, but it\'s perfect for what I wanted.',' positive'
'I needed a small little camera to carry around in my pocket and this camera filled the bill just right.  I wasn\'t expecting the same quality that my DSLR gives me, but I have to say I\'m impressed so far with the stills and movies I\'ve taken so far.  For those of you that seem to have problems getting good results I have to say you need to read the manual before blaming the camera.**update 3/5/14:I think all this type camera would have this problem, but I experienced huge LCD washout on outside shots even with the display brightness turned all the way up.  It was so bad that even on a cloudy day (snow on the ground which I know doesn\'t help) I had problems seeing the picture I was about to take.  When I reviewed the photos inside they turned out fine.  But I couldn\'t see well enough to frame the picture they way I would want.I didn\'t change from my 5 star rating because, like I said, I think all these cameras would have the same problem.',' positive'
'ok 1st but for most you need a sd card  i wish  theses kind of cameras would come with one maybe 4 gb one im not picky lol  its so tiny but so  good  seting not hard to set up at all  my dog zozo seemed to love the flash haha',' positive'

'I have had nothing but fun with this little camera it\'s capabilities are top notch for it\'s price range! I\'ve shot both stills and video to great effect I would suggest getting a large SD card because your going to want to take this with you everywhere!',' positive'
'I bought this as a gift for my mother who was having a hard time with her older camera. The interface was easy to use. Picture quality is good for a consumer camera. She was able to quickly figure out how to use it and easily upload photos to her computer using the SD card. There is no need for a cable with this camera, and no software to upload. There is a large screen on the back which is really convenient.',' positive'

'It arrived prior to Christmas and my son is very happy with it.  He would recommend this camera to others.',' positive'
'I bought this for a gift and for the price this camera is great! It has different settings for color and wide angle to a fish-eye lense.  Getting to the lenses and different color features is easy enough for a kid or an elderly adult to use. The pictures look great and for the money this was a great choice.',' positive'
'I bought this camera because of the 1) price and 2) ratings.  Top notch.  Small, light, full-function and easy to use.  Oh, and it takes great pictures, too.  This thing will fit right in your pocket and weighs a little less than my iPhone.  Good buy.',' positive'

'Small and easy to use. Exactly what we we\'re looking for. Price was excellent for a quality point and shoot',' positive'
'The battery in My Nikon Coolpix Camera will not hold a charge so I decided it was time to get another camera.  This camera was given a decent rating by Consumer Reports so I bought it.  I also purchased the case from the Canon website as they don\'t offer it on Amazon.',' positive'
'Easy to use, fast to set up, compact, couldn\'t be happier.  BTW, you can load the pics using just the flash memory card (I bought the SanDisk Ultra 16 GB)  I was worried I wouldn\'t be able to load the pics to the computer without the (not included) UCB cord.  The software tells you it \"needs\" the cord to select the right and appropriate yada yada...but that is not true because if you put the memory card into the computer the pictures load.',' positive'
'It works. It looked cheap to me at first, but the camera is actually really good. Not broken and it\'s small so it doesn\'t take up a lot of space.',' positive'

'I just got this camera, and ordered it based on the rave reviews at Amazon. They were right as far as I can see. For a moderate price, this camera has a large viewing screen. It does not require batteries because it has a rechargeable one. It has a good zoom lens. It is small and easy to carry. It is far superior to my old Polaroid digital camera, which took good pictures, so I expect this one will too.',' positive'

'I love this new Canon Camera ! It costed me 10 times less than my Canon Camera that I bought over 4 years ago which lasted that long. This new Camera has most of the important features in it that my old camera had. The features that it lacks I really won\'t miss too much. A few of the features that it has were not listed in the description so I feel I got a better deal than I expected. I\'m more than happy with this purchase. I\'d recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for a good one and is confused about which one to get because there is a lot of different cameras to choose from. Thanks !',' positive'

'Excellent images, not on par with my Nikon D50, but took great pix.  I would prefer a viewfinder.  The screen is a little hard to see in bright light, and the delay for a flash picture can be annoying, but overall, what more could I ask for under $100.',' positive'

'I did a lot of research and came to the conclusion that this camera offered me the most for the least amount of money.  I purchased for my wife\'s birthday and I wanted to get her a camera that was easy to use and took great pictures.  This product does just that.  not only does it take great pictures but also takes excellent video, up to an hour using the 16 GB memory card.  I own other canon products and have always been happy with there performance.  I was not disappointed with this camera.  It came as a bundle from Amazon, camera, 16 GB memory and case.  Great deal!',' positive'

'The camera was very good. But when I bought the camera and the rest of the stuff. You told me it would cost me $118.63? When I payed my bill. After words there was another $10.63 added on? What was that for? With all or the scams like with Target and all I would like to know what it was for?  Thank You.',' positive'
'For a small point & shoot camera, I was amazed at the results - even in low light conditions. My only complaint is about the charger -  wish it had a USB charger instead of external battery charger',' positive'
'Was also a Christmas gift for my  daughter. She used it to take pictures opening our presents at Christmas. She loves it.',' positive'
'The receiver of this camera is very pleased with it, and loves theway the pictures come out when transferred to the computer!',' positive'
'I bought this camera for my wife for Christmas. She loves it. She is a point and shoot persons and this camera takes great pics out of the box with no need to adjust the settings. It is also even lighter than the previous model Canon Powershot that she had. Definitely recommend it if you just want a point and shoot.',' positive'
'This was a Christmas gift for my husband. He doesn\'t like change so I wasn\'t sure he would give up his old bulky camera, but he did and loves this new one. It is small enough to take anywhere, the screen is a good size and the buttons are easy to operate. He likes to take videos and I love that there is a video button on the back of this camera. Great little camera and a good price too!',' positive'
'I purchased this camera to photograph our Christmas this year and it worked just described as an excellent deal for $60.',' positive'
'My 6-year-old wanted a camera for Christmas but I didn\'t want to waste money on a \"kiddie\" version. I wanted something easy for her to use and understand, but one that she could use for years to come.  This camera fits the bill. Very simple to use. She can now take pictures, videos, and is able to review and delete all on her own. The quality of picture is what you would expect from a point and shoot camera. Happy with my purchase and so is she.',' positive'
'A lot of my friends can\'t believe how crisp the pictures are even in low light conditions.  I have taken crisp pictures of small birds utilizing the zoom function.  For a low end camera, it takes very good pictures.  It pays to read the manual AND experiment with the function settings.  For example, there is a setting for low light conditions (which may trigger the flash) but I have found that changing the ISP speed to 1600 can give nice clear pictures in low light without a flash.  It pays to experiment with this camera since the correct settings result in brilliant pictures.  One really needs to take a lot of pictures of one subject in the same setting to get a good idea how these settings work.  Once you grasp the proper settings, the pictures are excellent!',' positive'
'fast shipment and wonderful camera to use.  Highly recommend this camera for it\'s price.  Was a perfect christmas gift to buy',' positive'
'Quick pictures, easy buttons.  Great for price!  good size screen.  We always stick with cannon.  5 stars for overall look, use.',' positive'
'Camera works great, easy to use. Clear and vivid pictures.When I purchased this camera on December 14th  the add also stated that it would come with a free memory card and case.  You were to click on the card and case to add to the order.  I did that.  I did not receive either one.  When I called Amazon the young man I spoke to asked his supervisor about it.  The supervisor stated that It was not an option on the add.  I said I didn\'t expect it to be on there now since the camera dropped in price.  However, that\'s what was offered when I purchased it.  I also advised them to check the reviews, I was not the only one with this complaint.  Just out of luck I guess!!!',' positive'
'I was looking for a small easy to use camera. I saw this one and it met all my needs. I\'ve only had it a short time but it takes beautiful clear pictures. Very easy  to use and handle. I love it and would tell people to buy',' positive'
'We wanted a camera that our 12 year old could use easily and express her creativity. She enjoys it daily for both photos and video clips!',' positive'
'This was purchased .as a gift for my youngest grandson. I tested it first charged the battery inserted the SDHC card and took several pictures. I liked the unit, small light weight great pictures. And the grandson was very surprised and excited about it. I rate it a Good buy at a good price.',' positive'
'If you are a novice picture as I am, why buy anything else? Drawback: it is difficult for me to hold the clip lever open while I am inserting the memory card. That is because I have a damaged left hand. I had to get a lady neighbor with long fingernails to insert mine. Smile!',' positive'
'This is the first camera I have owned in many years and it fits in my pocket so I can have quick access. It came with a cover which I truly appreciate. When I move the focus sometimes I end up with grainy pictures or blurry and for some reason it takes a few extra seconds to focus. I have missed some good shots because of that.  Another problem I had was not realizing what I clicked on that caused multiple shots and that was strange. I am still not sure how I fixed it either. However, overall for me and my qualifications, this is a good buy.',' positive'
'As usual, canon comes thru with a great little fill in camera. This is the second one and we love it',' positive'
'I got this camera for a friend she loves it the pictures are clearwe could have used a better case',' positive'

'This was a gift and the camera is very good for the low price I got it for. The pictures are nice.',' positive'
'I love that I have a camera again; this is more sophisticated than my previous camera, better focus, more user friendly, lighter and I love having a battery to recharge instead of having to buy double A batteries. What really chafes me, though, is that I had to pay $16 for a cable to upload photos to my computer -- Kodak gave you one with the camera purchase, and I think it\'s kind of cheesy for Canon not to supply one. BTW, the one I got was at Staples, someone said it had to be one made by Canon, not true, this works perfectly. I was lucky to find this when Amazon was running a deal where you got the memory card for free, I expect to have to pay for the memory card, but not the cable.',' positive'
'Bought this for my granddaughter\'s 11th birthday.  She loves it!!  It\'s a very nice camera for not a lot of money.  She showed me photos and videos that she\'s taken of the dogs playing and sleeping!  Small size makes it easy to slip into a pocket--perfect for a trip to Disney World or any vacation.',' positive'
'This camera is very easy to use and takes wonderful pictures. I had a very expensive larger camera that did not take pictures this good. I like the size of this Camera. It fits in my purse or pocket easily.',' positive'

'I just love my Canon PowerShot... It is small but powerful.  It takes wonderful pictures and the detail is awesome.  It is easy to use.  I would recommend this camera to anyone.',' positive'
'This camera is a little slower than my 8MP Canon -- but, the pictures are so well defined that you can crop a picture (taken from 100 yards away) and it isn\'t blurry when enlarged.  I like this camera -- easier to adjust the distance than my other Canon.',' positive'
'My wife is a teacher and needed a small camera to capture those special moments in her classroom. This camera fits in her purse and takes great pictures. She seems to be very happy with it.',' positive'
'Because it is great my grandma used to use a wind up camera and it used to make a lot of noise and know it is quiet at all of our activities',' positive'
'This camera is wonderful. I am enjoying my camera very much. It takes really good pictures and videos. Great buy',' positive'
'I would start by saying this is a very good \"cheap\" camera. It is ideal for novice users, or anyone who wants good vacation shots and is not a snob about cameras. It takes very high quality pictures and 720P HD video and is very easy and intuitive. It has nice big screen to look at picture and video you have taken and it interface with your pad or PC via USB or by SD card. The camera requires, but does not come with an SD card. I bought the 64gb card and it is my understanding this is the maximum this camera can use. It has 5x zoom which is not awesome, but adequate for the casual user.  Underwater housings are also available for this camera. For the price, ($69.00 using Amazon Prime) you cannot do better. This is vastly superior to my previous powershot.  It is an excellent bang for your buck and I love the size and quality for average use.',' positive'
'One of the best deals I got for this Thanksgiving! The camera is easy to use. And I cannot trust Cannon more on its great color.',' positive'
'I got this for my Granddaughter because she loved to use mine every time she came here.  It is a great point and shoot.  Takes super pictures and is very easy to use!!',' positive'
'I asked for this as a Christmas gift and am SO happy I did.  I am a professional photographer and wanted something small to put in my pocket and take to the park with my kids...my DSLR is big and bulky.  I fiddled with the camera for a while and was thinking it might be okay, but I would likely not use it much.  Then I turned off the flash and turned on the vibration control.  Now I LOVE it!  It takes great pictures, even indoors without a flash.  I am quite impressed and would highly recommend this camera.',' positive'
'Its small but gets the job done was surprized it had panaramic on it ive always like that feature gave it as christmas gift reciever was happy used it same day but it doesnt come with a case,sd card . Takes good pictures',' positive'

'This was a Christmas gift and loved the moment it was opened.  I think it has been put down only long enough to recharge the battery.',' positive'

'I had ordered everything to make a nice gift. The only thing that came was the camera. It was to be gift wrapped as is all the rest of my order. The camera was shrink wrapped to a piece of cardboard and my note was glued to the outside of the shipping box. I went out and bought a Scan Disc memory card and had a charged battery to fit. My wife was trying to learn how to use her new camera tonight. She asked about the caring case and extra memory card and battery and charger and I told her they had not arrived. I have been in contact wit 2 reps. of Amazon . com and they assured me that I would have the rest of my order the 23 and 24th. I would only hope that they are wrapped like a gift and my card put inside the box. Please make this a good gift as she will be going on a family trip right after Christmas day.  Thanks for the help Romone, I known you are doing your best to please this old man. Merry Christmas.  Gary Maurer',' positive'

'Really loving how easy this camera makes it to take a great picture. I have small children and to not get a blurry picture when they are jumping around is awesome. I am finally going to get some great photos! This camera is amazing for the price. It\'s like having a more expensive camera that fits in the palm of your hand! GREAT BUY!!! AAA+++++',' positive'

'I\'ve always had great success with my Cannons.  This is no different.  A really good camera at very good price.',' positive'
'very good basic entry level camera--large screen---have to go online to download the software for the camera, so you can download your pictures--also the instruction manual has to be downloaded online--which is okay, not really inconvenient--all in all, for less than $100--a really good buy!!',' positive'
'For my granddaughter and within just a couple minutes she was taking great pictures and video!  Very user friendly. Great buy.',' positive'
'My old Canon met by accident, so this was the new product to replace it.  Super easy to use.  Picture quality is excellent. And you can\'t beat the price.

'I do a lot of photography, own a lot of cameras including pricey ones by NIKON (7100) and CANON (G10)  and LUMIX (LX7) and SAMSUNG (GALAXY). I also own and use a lot two CANON POWERSHOT A4000 IS, for which I paid just over $100 each. Has the \"DIGIC 4\" chip used in many of their best DSLR cameras, a 3\" display, 8X optical and 8X digital zoom. The review is about the A2500, the little brother to the 4000. It also has the DIGIC 4 chip (that\'s something important, one smart brain in this box). It has a 28mm wide angle as does the A4000. It has only a 5X optical, 5X digital zoom. The \"IS\" stands for Intelligent systems, and while BOTH cameras take awesome pictures and represent for normal folks super deals that will keep up with the far more expensive cameras (like those listed above) for normal use, the A4000 IS deals with tricky lighting and the outer margins of early morning, late evening, backlit scenes, and so on, better than the A2500. BOTH are super deals. My tired eyes appreciate that larger display on the somewhat more expensive A4000 IS. I also like to \"crop tight\" meaning I really zoom in. That again is a slight advantage to the A4000 IS. If photography isn\'t a passion, either will do a great job. If you spend a few $$$ more the A4000 will give you that difference back over the years in quality shots under tougher situations.',' positive'
'very good product fulfilled with my expectations I had with it, I look forward to doing future business with you, thank you very much ....',' positive'
'I brought this camera for my wife who has trouble with camera settings. She loves how simplistic and easy it is to use the camera. Separate buttons for picture taking and video eliminates mistakes, and the camera takes very good pictures espcially for its price. She likes how light weight the camera is and also the charging case for the battery that doesn\'t have a cumbersome cord.',' positive'
'I purchased this camera on the recommendation of a friend who has an earlier model and is a professional photographer. It is exactly what I wanted and needed. I absolutely love it for its great, clear pictures and ease of use. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a light-weight, simple camera. I purchased a Canon because of the great results from previous Canons that I have owned. My last Canon wasn\'t working properly and I was unable to get replacement parts to due to its age, so this was a great replacement product.',' positive'
'Camera takes perfect pictures and is perfect size.  Take it everywhere.  All pictures are very clear and the camera is so easy to use',' positive'
'Does what it said it would, good value for the money.Fairly sturdy- already been dropped a couple of times.Good battery life. Good quality of the pictures, but I\'m not an expert, there.Took me a while to find the \" Delete all pictures\" in the menu options. Wish the choice was made easier wirth the trash can icon on the front.',' positive'
'I purchased this camera because of the size. It will come in handy hunting from a tree stand. Very small, light weight, and simple.',' positive'
'We bought this for our 12 year old to have at Christmas as her first camera.  It is really easy to use and has been a great camera and was a great price.  Nothing fancy, which is exactly what we wanted.',' positive'
'It is easy to use. Point and shoot. The pictures are good, even though we are unskilled. Recommend buying backup batteries. The 600mAh battery doesn\'t last a full day of hard use.I was surprised that the case was as efficient as it was. I expected a 3/4 opening to be a challenge but it was the perfect size to hold the camera in place when unzipped. Attach the carabiner to your belt loop. Slip the camera in the case with the wrist strap outside the case. Zip the case closed. Now the wrist strap can be used when removing the camera. It\'s reassuring to have the strap first.',' positive'
'Bought these for my two sisters....good price and they are happy with the product.  One sister bought the same one for a friend that never had a digital camera before and he is working it with no problem....didn\'t know it came with no SD card though !',' positive'
'This camera is fantastic, just what I wanted. It is the best camera I have now. It takes great pictures.',' positive'
'Seeing so many reviews with low ratings because people aren\'t reviewing properly. Review the actual product, when you complain about amazon or if it didn\'t come with a case or sd  card, that doesn\'t educate a buyer on the camera\'s performance. I see an overall star rating, and I\'m sometimes pushed away from a product because people are upset about things included in a sale. I want to know if the camera takes good pictures or how long the battery will last and people are rating it a 1,2,3 star because they are upset over accessory details and never even rate the actual camera. If you not happy with a purchase, send it  back, don\'t rate the camera a 1 star without even mentioning it, such as this review now has little merit on the camera.',' positive'
'We like this and the Elf version so much we have now bought another one for our second child. Great, easy to use camera that comes in a fun color and won\'t disappoint a 5-10 year old new camera user who also wants to take videos...but will also please the adult user who just wants a no-fuss compact digital camera with HD Video capability to tuck into a purse, pocket or bag for ease of use over a larger DSLR camera outfit. Bonous on our order of this product this time = it came with a free SD Card! Pairing it up with a CoreLogic slim case and it\'s a great Santa Gift for our child!',' positive'

'I love Canon.  I had an A2300, and needed to replace it, so I went with a model as similar as possible.  This model has built-in  instructions, so you don\'t HAVE to have a manual.  The photos are great for my applications.  I didn\'t realize it came WITHOUT a memory card (gee, I thought I was getting a GREAT price) so I was delayed in getting started with it.  Overall, though, I would highly recommend this camera.',' positive'
'Like many other owners of this camera, I downloaded the manual onto my iPad2 home screen rather than print the 100-plus pages. There are many functions to discover and implement--including a self-timer, and the iPad makes it convenient to learn the functions, even when I am waiting at the doctor\'s office. That being said, I still have not learned all the functions because the numerous icons therein are like learning a foreign language. But I AM learning them little by little.Because I am a beginner with digital cameras, I am using the most-basic functions first, such as using auto-focus pretty nearly exclusively to help me become familiar with the camera. So far so good, and I truly enjoy using the camera and printing the photos, which have all come out to my satisfaction. Getting back to the manual:  This 100-plus page manual is packed with information making this camera surprisingly high-tech for such a compact camera. Without the manual to describe and explain all the functions, I doubt that I would enjoy this camera as much as I do. And the camera price is extremely reasonable, as is that of the case that protects it well.As for having to buy a memory card, as one reviewer pointed out, when we used to buy NEW film cameras we did not expect to receive a free roll of film with it.USB cable not included! either! but check the online manual and you may find it listed under \"Optional Accessories.\"',' positive'
'Fast power up, fewer missed shots. Rechargable batteries can be quickly swapped out ( buy more than one). Small enough to fit a purse or pocket. I really enjoy the features of this camera. Digital photos enlarge to 8x10 easily, without loss of crispness.',' positive'
'I like Canon and had older one like this which made taking pictures easier. Great upgrades and like the red color too.',' positive'

'This is a great camera for anyone who wants to give it as a gift to a person who may not be familiar with digital cameras and the basics of photography. The camera is extremely easy to use and simple menus and controls make it very easy for someone who maybe doesn\'t have the best familiarity with electronics or cameras in general. Highly recommend!',' positive'

'I\'m very happy with this camera. It\'s very easy to use, the battery lasts a long time, and the pictures come out great!',' positive'
'I got this to replace a Sony point and shoot camera that started taking somewhat lousy photographs through no fault of my own. It\'s great for events where a more professional camera would be a hassle to carry, but a cell phone camera would be lacking. I used it at a meet and greet after a concert, and it took excellent photos of the artist and me. I used it recently to snap some photos of Christmas lights, and I was pleased at the quality. It\'s a great budget camera, with a small zoom, but it takes great photos.FYI, some people complained because it doesn\'t contain a USB transfer cable, it\'s easier to just take the SD card out and put it directly in your computer to transfer photos.',' positive'
'I decided to buy this camera for the great\'s reviews and comments from other customers. I though that it was a great opportunity to get my first camera (as the offer said that you would get some items free with the purchased of some camera listed), and really it was. Finally I got the camera which meets all my expectations. But I though that memory card and the Amazon basics compact camera case will be sent with my purchase, since the offer said that those items came free with my purchase (Cannon Powershot A2500). I have a chat with a Customer representative (Manisha) and now they are going to send me the items that I did not received previously. Thanks Amazon for your understanding.  Thanks for your support.',' positive'

'Very nice camera. Am surprised how light it is and how far technology has come. Easy to use and all my previous chargers and SD cards and batteries from older canons work with it.',' positive'
'Well I must say I made a great buy. This little baby came with a rechargeable battery charger and a wrist string, I can\'t believe that!  It is so small and cute, light weight and takes out such clean and crisp pictures and it is easy to use. It is not complicated like some other digital cameras. All the steps are one after the other at the touch of your thumb. This is not a professional camera but can be used for those who like to travel whether home or abroad or just to have fun pics. I love it and would recommend it to you.',' positive'
'My answer to this is somewhat paradoxical in that once you have figured out all of the complexities of the menu functions and how to set it up...it becomes one of the best quality and easily operated digital cameras of its kind. Simply as advice to the prospective buyer I would hardily advise you to purchase its case and a good high quality (#10) Flash Memory Card with this camera. Even though it functions extremely well and is quite competitive with higher priced cameras it is small and delicate in nature. sms',' positive'
'Great price for a great camera. It\'s easy to use.  I especially like the zoom. I bought a case and a memory card at the same time, and everything came to less than $100.',' positive'

'I needed an small, inexpensive yet dependable point and shoot camera for a three week cycling vacation.  After checking camera reviews on Amozon as well as other sites, I chose the Power Shot A2500.  After over 250 photos I have not been disappointed.  I assumed the camera would be easy to use and reliable but I admit that the quality of the pictures exceeded my expectations.  Many of my pictures were taken after a quick stop on my bicycle with little time spent prior to pressing the button.  Still I was very pleased with the results.',' positive'

'My husband has a very expensive, very big camera that takes beautiful pictures, but is just too cumbersome to carry everywhere.  There have been numerous times that we\'ve seen something that would be a wonderful picture but we didn\'t have the camera with us.  This camera fits right in my purse and I carry it everywhere and have already taken some pictures that we would have missed otherwise.  Just what I had been asking for.',' positive'

'I love the Canon series of digital cameras. This is the fourth one of the several that I have purchased over several years, because I have purchased them as presents for my grown kids. This one has 16 megapixels, and it takes great photos of things that are moving. I took a photo that included the TV in the shot, and the close up showed the picture on the screen of the TV perfectly.  I have a slight tremor in my hands, and I can take good pictures using this camera despite this. I have also been known to accidentally drop my camera, even though I try to use a lanyard around my neck to secure it. So far, even with dropping it, my older Canon camera hasn\'t needed to be repaired.',' positive'
'My daughter was very excited about getting this camera. It was just what she wanted and Cannon is a high quality product in my opinion.',' positive'
'I love my new Canon camera - very easy to use and takes beautiful photos!  I highly reccomend it to everyone!',' positive'
'Great Camera. Good flash, good optics and very nice color. I strongly recommend this camera. You will get great photos are they are very easy to use.',' positive'
'I am no photographer.  But my work takes me all over the world.  I could not kill my 5 year old pocket cannon - It took took excellent photos even tho the back viewer quit working.  But the viewfinder worked so I kept snapping.  I finally broke down and purchased this one for a trip to Scotland.  1/2 half the weight and twice as many pixels as my old one.  Plus it uses the same batteries, case and SD cards!  AND the anti-shake feature really works!  And everyone love my photos! and it is the size as my cellphone! Hooray to Canon.  What a great deal!',' positive'
'tiny and easy to carry in your pocket, takes great photos, I uploaded some for everyone to see ... the only thing is that when you push the button, it takes time till the camera clicks, so if your cat moves, till it clicks, the cat is gone. but what you want for 68 bucks? a leica? it is a marvel of the modern technology for this tiny price and here is a video i took in sunny california few days ago with this camera while driving in a car, the video and audio is greathttps://archive.org/details/MVI0488',' positive'

'I was a little hesitant at first about getting the camera because some reviews said it wasn\'t user friendly, and I am not a \"tech-savy\" person.  However, I found the camera very easy to use, and I LOVE IT!My main reason for purchasing this camera over others is for the rechargeable battery.  I was so tired of always putting in new batteries in my old camera, not using it for a month, and then discovering that I\'d soon need new batteries again.  Love the ability to recharge!Great product and at the right price too!',' positive'

'My wife and I love this little camera. It takes super pictures and it so easy to use a 4th grader would know how to use it. I like that it fits in the palm of your hand, the battery lasts and lasts, the videos I took were crisp and sharp, and the price was the best deal in town. It is perfect for any occasion, and the accessory transfer cable not only acts as a charger, but allows me to transfer my pictures to my photo program without having to open the camera and remove the SD card. Not fancy, but practical for the price.',' positive'
'I bought this camera to visit my daughter, who is living in France, and my 5 month old grandson. I have a bigger camera, which I also love, but wanted a camera that would be small enough to fit in my pocket and purse. This camera is great for that reason.  It is very easy to operate, which is also great!',' positive'
'The camera is light weight and is very user friendly and easy to access especially for someone with a vision disorder.

'I bought this little camera because we recently had our first grandchild, and I knew I would want to take easy, spontaneous photos.  It fits nicely in my purse, or pocket.

'My old Kodak digital bit the dust and I needed a point & shoot camera for my vacation.

The only negative thing for me is that I had to download and print the \'full\' users manual so I didn\'t have to read it online.',' positive'
'I am happy to comment regarding the camera.  It is very easy to use and light weight.  I purchased it as a graduation gift and my grandson and the rest of the family are enjoying it.  However, there was one problem.  The cord to connect to the computer was not included in the package and I had already given it to my grandson.  He needed it right away so I could not return it.  Other than that, they are very satisfied.Thank you for your kind attention.Respectfully submitted,Frances E. Priester',' positive'

'This is my 6th point and shoot (P&S) camera in 9 years, ranging in price from $200-$300. I have had 1 Bell & Howell, 3 Nikons and this is my 2nd Canon P&S camera. The last 2 P&S cameras I had I literally wore out by taking so many pictures. I bought this as a second camera for my husband (who doesn\'t usually take pictures) to use when he goes hunting with my son. I chose a Canon because I have a Canon DSLR and love it. I also wanted an inexpensive camera, because I thought it would sit on the shelf for most of the year. Of course it did not come with a memory card, as I have yet to buy any camera that does.To test this camera, after shooting indoors for a bit, I took it to the park. Luckily, what started out as a sunny day turned cloudy, allowing me to test the camera in different lighting. This is a typical low priced P&S camera.  Like all P&S cameras, this one performs best in bright, outdoor lighting. However, the ease of use and quality of pictures for the small price tag makes this a good buy. This is one of the better P&S cameras I have had.Although no instruction manual was in the box (other than the very basics), it was easy to figure out how to manually set this camera, which is a must for me. I liked the fact that it has a PROGRAM setting, which allows me to set a program manually. Even if I switch to another setting, it saves my manual settings, allowing me to switch back and forth between settings. That was great when I tested it, because the lighting went from sunny to cloudy and back again. I could easily switch from AUTO to LANDSCAPE to PROGRAM (my manually programmed settings) and back, depending on lighting and activity, all while holding my 6 month old. The pictures I took while holding my baby (who was trying to grab the camera) of my 4 other children who were riding a moving train turned out surprisingly good. I also manually adjusted the ISO to 1600 and took some shots while holding my squirming baby, and the pictures were not as noisy as I thought they would be.This is a great camera for the price. I would definitely recommend it for anyone, especially those who are ready to do some manual adjustments to get better pictures, but not ready to spend a lot of money. I am glad I bought this camera, and I am happy because I think I will actually use it more than I originally thought!',' positive'
'I am a fan of Canon Camera\'s, and have an older version of the Canon Rebel. However although I really bought this camera for my wife, I do enjoy taking it with me when I am out myself. It is easy to slip into the pocket, and quick to get ready to take a photo. The quality of the photos is brilliant. The colors are so vivid, and real. The Auto-focus is perhaps the best that I have seen is a compact digital camera. The screen shows what points the camera is focusing on, so you know instantly your subject is in focus - of it you need to re-frame your image.Most importantly the actual photo taking is quick. Some digital cameras will blur when the subject moves at the point the photo is taking, because of the delay in processing the photo onto your memory card. I\'ve not had any such problems with this camera.I would recommend this camera to serious photographers who, like me just like to carry a camera everywhere they go. Or as a 1st camera for someone new to digital photography.',' positive'
'We love our canon PowerShot A2500 Digital Camera.  It is very compact, light, but works like the big camera\'s.  It takes great pictures, the zoom feature is fantastic and photo\'s can be easily downloaded to your computer.  For the value, this is an exceptional camera.',' positive'

'i bought the powershot for a class reunion weekend and it excelled! it gave me several hundred of the nicest photos i\'ve ever taken and i cant wait to take it out and take some more photos! a couple videos too that also was very easy to do. what i really like about the powershot is you can SEE the photos right as you take it,  so say one was blurry due to new user error. it shows you the photo and you can say right away \" nope try again\"  that was VERY handy along with showing people thier photos in case they wanted a try #2. same with erasing very easy.before i bought this i knew nothing about Digital cameras, the last one i had was a film camera ten years ago. so this was my first digital camera purchase, and what a brilliant purchase it was, the amazon reviews and basic instructions were enough to know what i need and how use it, you must have a photo memory card ( not sent with the camera so when it says do you want the package YES you do!)  and you must charge the battery beforehand and check it, if you are away from home make sure you take the battery charger and if you\'ve used it alot check the battery i forgot to do that and the third night i couldnt take photos. it warned me.. i just thought.. nah.. it will be okay. ( nope but once it charged it was fine) but not only was it easy for me to take clear wonderful photos of my reunion weekend, it was easy for my friends taking photos with it too to just use it as well.  the automatic sensing flash was nice too. the digital uploads of the photos ( with separate purchase of the cable) also could not have been easier. i also liked the little bag that came with the package. it had a nice belt clip. also if i didnt have a belt loop it was very easy to tuck in my pocket and not have to schlump a large camera and case along. it was dropped by accident on a hardwood floor and kept on going with no problems.  everybody went oh no! and i was like nope! its good! say cheese!the price couldnt have been nicer also.. very pleased with my new Canon Powershot!',' positive'

After serious thinking and seeing reviews, I decided to go with the Cannon PowerShot. I gambled with the Bad reviews, and it payed off. A great buy, and awesome camera. I have NO complaints with this camera. I figure that the bad reviews on this were either people who don\'t like Canon, or they received a camera that was wonky directly from the factory. No complaints with this camera. My dad loves it, it takes awesome pictures. Definitely a good buy.',' positive'
'The only problem is that there is no manual for it...online or otherwise...but it is simple enough that I figured it out. It takes awesome low light pictures',' positive'

'As a long time Canon compact camera user my favorite new features on the A2500 are...The Canon PowerShot A2500 does not just stop at taking images but is rather adept at handling videos as well. It is capable of producing 720p HD files at the touch of a button. One of the thoughtful things about this camera is the inclusion of the movie button. You do not have to fidget about with all sorts of controls in order to get the video going. Rather you go back to that simple button and the rest is history.Another nice feature is that this product is newly minted with an ECO mode which is designed to reduce the power consumption on your camera.The Canon brand has made cameras its specialty and the Canon PowerShot A2500 holds true to type. This model brings out all the features that you would expect of a camera of its class but has the added advantage of making it easier for the consumer to access those features. In other words you get the best of both worlds with a great camera and easy usage.Verdict:There are no major surprises with the Canon PowerShot A2500. It is a great camera that does what it says on the box.If you are looking for the next model up check out the Canon SD330 as it has another level of features and quality.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B5HE3UU/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00B5HE3UU&linkCode=as2&tag=stupisms-20',' positive'

'I love my new camera.  I wanted a little point and shoot for vacation and to use when I visit my grandson.  It fits in my pocket, easy to use.  And, in my opinion the pictures are great for a point & shoot.',' positive'
'The best pocket camera on the market for the price! There are 3 different cameras by Cannon in this category, go with the A2500 for added overall quality for just a small increase in price! I had been looking at point & shoot cameras, reading all the specs. along with remarks by other customers for about 3 months. I got this for my wife for her birthday and she is very picky after going through 3 previous cameras unsuccessfully, she has been very happy with this one(finally)!',' positive'
'I purchased this camera because it is the camera that my daughter has.  It gives ME an opportunity to take photos of my very first grandchild.  The camera is easy to use and I can instantly see the picture after taking it.  It is AWESOME!',' positive'

'For $99 this is a good camera.  I needed something lightweight for hiking/fishing etc when I do not want to take my SLR.  The quality is fine and the capabilities are good for the money.  Battery lasted 10 days with light use including some video, so I feel that is OK.  This camera allows you to always have a capabilty in your pocket, certainly better than the typical phone camera, and with longer battery life.',' positive'
'This is my first digital camera and it\'s so easy even I can take great pictures. I especially like that I can take stills and videos with the same camera.  I highly recommend this camera.',' positive'

'My good ol\' Elph 7mp finally faded after years of hard use.  I miss its steel case and classy style, but this replacement is working out fine.  I fail to understand complaints -- this is a nifty little vade mecum (that\'s, like, Latin, like, y\'know) that does what it is designed to do and as advertised.  For heavy lifting I have my Canon Rebel (yes, I\'m a complete amateur).Last year I bought the Nikon J1 as a pocket camera.  It broke.  Nikon did not honor its own written warranty, but in compensation I enjoy telling people why it\'s held together with rubber bands.  That is my first and last Nikon.  Unless Canon has changed in the home office, they honor their warranties.',' positive'
'This was a gift for my Mother and, so far, it is working out great.  We both hate that you can\'t see the screen on cameras when your using them in the bright sun and, even if it is \"old school\" thinking, I still love to use a view finder while taking pictures.',' positive'

'So far so good! I love it, lots of bells and whistles. If you get this Camera USE a case don\'t stick it in your pocket (any of them) or drop it in a purse. the telescope lens will get dirty and stick on you, causing it to shut down and not work, do not take pictures in a sand storm. it will make movies audio is good, heck for the price you can\'t beat it. just keep it out of harms way.buy the Energizer ch4wb4 recharge Smart AA/AAA charger with the NiMH batteries, they last 30\% longer than any others on the market, with my 16GB card and those batteries I filmed for a 1 1/2 with audio, try that with anything else.only con -Amazon sent me a broken one first, but they quickly sent me a replacement camera. jard is shipping and it was bubble wrapped, Lens Shut down, so you need to treat this camera like a camera not a ceil phone.',' positive'
'You could spend several hundred dollars on a nice camera, but for the price - this one takes very good pictures.',' positive'

'The images are great, the focusing is superb and it uses AA cells. What\'s not to like? Those looking for a point and shoot can\'t go wrong with this camera.',' positive'
'This is a great little cannon camera.  To me the best feature is the view finder.  I had a hard time finding a small camera that had this feature.  I find it hard to take pictures on sunny days with cameras without a viewfinder.  The pictures are of great quality for a point and shoot.',' positive'
'Two reasons I picked this camera. It has a view finder because you can\'t always see the screen in the bright outdoors. Second, the batteries. I don\'t have to carry a battery charger when I travel. If my batteries run down when I am on the go, I can always find AAs. I use rechargeable AAs and have had no issues mentioned in previous reviews. I do use the newest kind, which may hold the charge better. Takes great photos. It\'s a great pocket camera when I don\'t want to take my big Canon.',' positive'
'We needed a small low cost camera to carry around for those unexpected shots.  Well this is it.  May get another one to keep ready in the car.',' positive'

'This is a compact wide screen in the back camera. It also takes great video being 16 megapixel the detail is amazing the only negative is storage space videos being a gig at a time. It is a simple camera and takes aa batteries. I have also taken quick running dog photos with out much blurring!',' positive'
'I love this camera.  \"Science News\" ran an article proving that it\'s possible for a human being to actually fall in love with an inanimate object.  Well, I\'m in love!  I bought an earlier version of this camera (A1200) several years ago.  Though I have a DSLR system including two Canon cameras (20D and 10D) and 17-40L, 200L, 70-200L top notch lenses, I always grab my little Canon A1200 when I go anywhere.  This little jewel has a real, bright, \"tunnel\" viewfinder as well as a large (2.7\"), brilliant LCD.  This is not to mention a five power Canon lens!  Frankly, I see this camera as the little brother of the pro Canon G series -- I have the G10 model and the A1400 almost matches it when its photos are enlarged to 8\" X 10\".  Don\'t underestimate the capabilities of the A1400\'s 1/2.3 sensor!  Take a portrait of a lovely young girl and see every eyelash, every hair, every gleam in her eyes.',' positive'
'I was on a tight budget- my camera before this one just stopped working one day after the warranty ended.Does simple shots with ease. Lack of too many controls forces you to be more creative.',' positive'
'I carry and shoot a Nikon D800 but I have been looking for a long time for a very compact point and shoot that I can stick in my pocket for those occasional shots when my big camera may not be accessible.  This is perfect.  Takes AA batteries and has a viewfinder which is getting almost impossible to find on a point and shoot.  I don\'t do well taking pics using the lcd display!',' positive'
'I am not a professional picture taker by any means.  I do, however; enjoy having pictures from every occasion.  This is a small camera that takes good pictures.  The only drawback for me is it didn\'t come with any instructions!  I had to ask a younger person how to operate some of the functions on the camera.  I am happy with the pictures.',' positive'
'I needed a camera to shoot my artwork for portfolios and this was exactly what I needed. It is easy to operate and such a good price for a quality camera.',' positive'
'This camera is just great! I was looking for an affordable camera that would save me some budget and still deliver some value. Then I stumbled upon this one in Amazon. It is perfect and black is my favorite color. I\'m impressed by it\'s perfomance.',' positive'
'I just returned another camera from another company, which required about an hour of reading just to get it to work, and after a month of trying, it never did work right. Too many damn bells & whistles. The reviews on this Canon model looked promising, and I was able to start taking pictures with it in about 5 minutes right out of the box. (Of course I\'m a guy, I mess with stuff first & then read the directions) Still, with just a few minutes of reading, the basic functions got figured out & I ran all around the house & yard taking test photos everywhere. Not a bad shot in the batch. Then I found out quite accidently that it was already compatible with my Mac\'s I-Photo program. Just plugged it in & the photos downloaded, ready for me to process. This one\'s a keeper.',' positive'
'I am happy with my recent purchase of the canon powershot a1400 16.0 mp digital camera with 5x digital image, it\'s easy to use and the compact size makes it easy to carry.',' positive'

'my grandson loves it.takes great pictures. for the price great buy.as good as any camera on the market.all so it takes movies what he likes.',' positive'
'The view finder is the icing on the cake of this little gem. Compact, regular AA cells and stick in your pocket, who could ask for more. It will find a place in my wife\'s purse. Seems like a better option than  using a smart phone. Pictures are for cameras not telephones.',' positive'
'I am not a tech savvy person, therefore this meets my needs.  I like the view finder as well as the little screen.',' positive'
'I love this camera! It\'s got plenty of perks for a low price, starting with plenty of great shooting modes...or just leave it on auto and enjoy the simplicity of great pics with zero effort. The 720p video was a pleasant surprise as well, I find myself using it much more than I thought I would, it makes videos a breeze to shoot. Battery life with rechargeable batteries is great, with over 250 pics taken before a recharge was needed and being able to use regular alkaline AA\'s is a nice thing to have when on vacation.I love the size as well, small enough to slip into a pocket, but designed as such as to allow easy one handed use, something I think is essential when using a camera. All told, for the low price, this is a no brainer if your looking for ease of use, great pics, and good video with Canon\'s great quality added.',' positive'
'Gave this camera as a Christmas present this year and it was a huge hit. Outstanding picture quality. Easy to use and has all the bells and whistles.',' positive'
'A gift for my granddaughter this year. It takes great photos. She will soon be a famous photographer with this fine tool.',' positive'
'You simply can\'t find a digital camera with this price performance combination that happens to have a traditional view finder. I love this camera and use the lithium batteries on it. It takes great pictures and is a very capable camera.',' positive'
'The one thing that I really like about this camera is that has a view finder. This is not often found on this type of camera any more.Secondly, I like that it uses standard AA batteries as I use it on the Job and don\'t have time for recharging! Also, by not using the LCD screen while taking pictures, it saves a lot of battery life.',' positive'
'We are very pleased with the functionality and ease of use of this camera. The photographs are very good quality. What we really like and the reason for the purchase was the viewfinder (eyepiece) this camera has. All too often, the visual display on the camera back is \"washed out\" and difficult to see in strong sunlight. The viewfinder allows the subject to be captured perfectly under all light conditions. No complaints about this camera; also a very reasonable price, and we like the idea that it utilizes easy to obtain AA batteries, both alkaline and rechargeable.',' positive'
'Bought this for my 12 year old grandson. Just developing an interest in photography.  Thought this would be a good start.',' positive'
'I bought this camera for my mother, because I borrowed her camera when I went on a trip. When her camera returned back home the shutter did not open anymore. Ooops! So, being the favorite and only son, I shopped and bought her this camera. This camera is a huge step up from the camera she had and she absolutely loves it. She says this was to be her Christmas, but I told her it is only a replacement for the camera I borrowed and returned useless. I\'m glad I was able to borrow mom\'s old camera so I could replace the old with a new, awesome, updated camera!',' positive'
'This is not the very latest, but it is one of the few small cameras you can now buy which have an optical viewfinder, which I think very important outdoors when it is hard to see the LCD.  I also chose it because it uses two AA batteries, so that my grandchild would not find it useless if she had forgotten to charge it.  Of course, she can use rechargeable AA.',' positive'
'The camera was a present for my mom who wanted a simple point and shoot camera. This camera has met her needs.',' positive'
'Hi,I have my main Canon SX260 camera & this little one is a backup. Sometimes, when you travel near or far, it\'s nice to know you have a very adequate backup when your main camera might have an accident? My SX260 is very nice (has a sturdy metal case, full hd, 20x zoom, fantastic!)  BUT the A1400 has a CCD sensor while my SX260 uses the CMOS (the CCD type sensor gives you  a better quality picture). Also, the A1400 has a larger 16.1 Megapixel effective image size but the SX260 only has 12.1 megapixels (interesting?). Even the newer SX280 model keeps those same CMOS & 12.1 megapixel sensors?I really love the view finder on the A1400 (on so many occasions, that sun is directly overhead) and unless you have one of those \"TILT LCDs\", it drives me crazy to clearly see what I\'m trying to film? And of course, the double AA battery power (for colder areas, you can buy some extra lithium to prevent any freeze-up) is fantastic. You can get double AAs anywhere, plus most of us have the Eneloop rechargeables?This camera is small & lite and will fit in most pockets, especially anything like cargo shorts. The camera gives great still pics & the HD is fine but of course my SX260 is way better in anything with video. Yet, I know my little backup camera will provide me with nice pics & HD vids wherever I am, if my main camera ever stops working properly! Finally, around ($60.) for a nice, new Canon camera, this was a real easy choice for me?-------------------------------------------TIPS:?01 - I use a leftover (rock the frogskins, pacific blue / Oakley nylon sunglass bag/pouch, looks really good!) to cover/protect the camera/lens. Of course, these bags are the micro type & nice if you ever have to wipe some speck of dust/dirt off your lense. For me, the nylon pouch is fine for this small backup and they sell them at any mall.02 - 2 extra slim case, Sandisk 32gb SDHC cards with the camera, easily fit in this bag.03 - Also, Amazon sells these cool \"PowerPax Storacell Slim Line\" AA battery caddies & they work great.  Their orange color will make a nice contrast and they have many other colors available?04 - Another nice thing about this camera is that the insides, actually have markings for the proper way to face your memory card & batteries. My SX260 doesn\'t, so if I haven\'t used it for awhile (markings would be helpful?). The A1400 can also use the higher capacity SDXC, eXtra capacity memory card. For me, this newer SDXC card is great, 64 or 128GB, you can movie forever. Yet, my old VISTA system isn\'t fond of it, I have to use one of those USB computer cords to download (AMAZON, sells an A1400 cord for around $6.00). It immediately loads the (JPEC & MOV), no problem. Then, I\'ll double-click the \"MOV\" and Apples Quicktime will convert, I\'ll login to Utube where the movie file is converted to an \"MP4\" format, so easier to manage!05 - Lastly, sometimes you might be taking pics around water (a boat ride under the Golden Gate or the surf around some rocky beach - lots of spray), nevermind it might be one of those drizzle days? If your just taking tourist or web shots, why risk getting moisture on the lens or in-between the zoom mechanism of your best camera, use the A1400 (16.1 megapixels) ain\'t bad and I\'m thinking of buying another (just for this reason alone?).-------------------------------------------SX280:1080p/60p Full HD videoWith the camera\'s advanced DIGIC 6 Image Processor enabling \"MP4\" format recording, the PowerShot SX280 HS lets you shoot video at a selectable frame rate of 60 fps or 30 fps. 1080p/60p Full HD video is extraordinarily smooth and rich in playback, ensuring that your important memories and creative film clips look their absolute best. Video recorded at 30 fps has also been improved through the combination of the DIGIC 6 Image Processor and Fine Movie Detail Processing, with reduced noise and high resolution.-------------------------------------------',' positive'

'I was looking for a camera that had the following criteria:Universal AA or AAA batteries (not proprietary Li-ion or other technologies), HD Video recordingLightweight, \"easy to use\" and not that many buttons, and inexpensiveThis camera meets my criteria.(1) Here\'s a further explanation of the battery issue:The problem with Li-ion batteries is that once a manufacture changes the battery pack and no longer makes the battery it becomes hard to find. Li-ion batteries have a shelf life of about 2 years (from the data of manufacture) & if they haven\'t been charged in that time frame, they will not last very long. Once they are fully discharged they may not \"recover\". You could end up buying a new battery pack and only getting at best 4-6 shots before needing a recharge.The Canon A1400 uses 2 AA batteries. My preference is two use Sanyo (now Panasonic) Eneloop NiMH (Nickel Metal Hydride) Rechargeable batteries. I have over 5 years of experience using these throughout the household. They can be recharged from 1500 to 1800 times (depends on the series) and can hold up to 90\% of their charge for up to a year. I carry two in the camera and two as spares in a compact camera case (Case Logic DBC-302 purchased here on Amazon as an \"add-on\" purchase and therefore discounted).With Alkaline batteries you can take up to 150 (screen on), 200 (ECO mode), or 500 (screen off) still shots (less if you use flash and/or zoom a-lot or playback (review) shots. With NiMH rechargeable, the number of shots increase to 500 (screen on), 600 (ECO mode) or up to 1100 (screen off). In Screen off mode, you use the built-in viewfinder - which is becoming increasingly difficult to find in an \"entry-level\" camera.(2) You can quickly change the default picture size from 16MP (default) to 8MP, 2MP, 0.3MP (VGA) or Widescreen using the \"Func./Set\" button on the back of the camera.(3) The camera includes digital (not optical) image stabilization (IS) which is better than nothing. For still images without a tripod or slow moving scenes, it works fairly well. For fast action scenes, the camera takes 3 shots and then chooses the best one to use. Again for the price you pay it would be hard to find a point and shoot camera that uses optical image stabilization.(4) You can record (make) movies in 720p resolution. This was another reason that I wanted this camera. I have a larger DSLR (Olympus E-620) and 5 lenses to go with it that is great for shooting a lot of different kinds of pictures (close-up, far away or fast action), but it does not have the ability to record (make) a movie. So this camera fills a void and does so at a nice price point. It\'s a good daily or spur of the moment camera.(5) I wish it came with a printed manual, a USB cable and at least a 1 or 2 GB SD card but it came with none of these items. It does come with a wrist strap and a pair of alkaline batteries. Fortunately, I was able to download the manual and use a 2 GB (class 4) & 16 GB (class 10) SD card that I had laying around at home. It works well with either density or speed.(6) Although it does not come with software, you can download some free software at the Canon website that allows you to import pictures from the camera with a USB cable or through a USB card reader to:  Manage/Print the images, and Edit the pictures as follows:(a) Correct Red-eye,(b) Auto Correct,(c) Adjust color and Brightness,(d) Increase Sharpness,(e) Crop Image,(f) Insert Text,(g) Stitch photos (to create a panoramic photo),(h) Edit Movies, and(i) Extract Multiple images from Movie (this feature alone makes the \"free\" software worthy enough of a download/install.The software works on Windows (from 95 to 8.1), Mac OS 8 to OS X 10.9, and Linux (something for everyone).To get the software, go to the Canon website, click on Support, pick a region of the world and then a country, then \"Consumer & Home office\", then \"Powershot cameras\", then \"Powershot A series\", and finally scroll down & select the \"Powershot A1400\" camera. Once there, you\'ll be able to download the user manuals, guides and/or brochures as well as the software.On balance this is a great entry level camera with a lot of useful bells and whistles (features). I recommend that you download one or both of the searchable PDF manuals. It takes decent pictures & easily slips into your pocket (but I prefer to use a compact camera case more for protection than anything else). It comes with a wrist strap, a pair of alkaline AA batteries and a 1 year warranty. Its a camera for all ages.Like anything, the more you use the camera in different settings & modes the better you get at using it. The \"auto\" mode is nice when there is plenty of light, it\'s also a great learning tool as you get to see what the camera chose on your behalf. You can also turn off the digital zoom and rely only on the 5x optical zoom.If you find that you need more flash \"light\" (something that extends the flash range up to 30 feet), look at the Canon HF-DC1 that sells for around $52 here on Amazon. It\'s triggered by the built-in flash (recall that light travels pretty fast) and can come in handy.As with every camera product, you can spend more money and get something better but at every price point you can make that decision. For me the last criteria is that the camera was inexpensive and this camera also meets that criteria. Good luck with your search & or purchase.',' positive'
'I like this camera. I also liked the price!! I like that it has disposable batteries instead of recharging ones.',' positive'

'My old small camera has a view finder, I have been looking for a new camera with a higher MP, but could not find one with the view finder feature, until Canon came out with this model.  View finders are great, especially when in high sun light.  I am able to focus on the photo to be taken without the display being washed out due to sunlight.',' positive'
'Outstanding value. It replaces an excellent older Power Shot A530 with more capacity & features.  It is virtually impossible to find a small camera in this category with both a visual view finder and a good screen together.  A GREAT SMALL CAMERA!  Thanks Canon for making this type of camera again. Our A530 has traveled across the globe operating flawlessly. I assume the A1400 will function flawlessly for years too!',' positive'
'Not only is this camera easy to use, it is smaller than the previous A1200 model that it replaced.  It fits in the A1200 case. The A1200 was a tight fit in this case, and it fell out of the case and got damaged.',' positive'
'Photos and exposure settings on the Canon A1400 are superior to smartphones.  Having the optical view finder allows for more steady shots; since, my head does not shake as much as my extended arms.  This 16 megapixel image quality is equal to my 5 year old $320 Canon A650 with 12 MP, which had received 1st place prizes in amateur photo contests.  My image quality comparisons at ASA 100 were made using a tripod with both cameras.  Also, how can one beat using light weight 9X-life lithium AA batteries that last for hundreds of photos and image reviews?  Furthermore, when comparing the A1400 to the smartphone, there is a flash which reaches 10 feet or more.  So you should buy one of these before Canon pulls more models from the market.  I recommended that friend buy this camera one year ago, and I wish I had bought mine then too.',' positive'
'It\'s hard to find a camera with both an LCD screen and a viewfinder these days. This camera has both, it is simple to use, very user friendly and takes really great pictures. I am 100\% satisfied and would definately recommend it.',' positive'

'I got this one to replace my old Nikon that got broke during a trip to Germany.  At first the Camera felt cheap but it grew on me. The more I use this camera, the more I liked it.  Set up was extremely easy and straight forward. Now sure there is a better cameras out there but not at this price range in my honest opinion.  Yes, I don\'t use it but Eye-Fi is supported. http://support.eye.fi/cameras/canon/powershot_a1400I was going to give it one less star for not coming with a USB cable or any Cables for that matter.  But it made up for this because its mini USB input is none-proprietary, yes that\'s right standard.  One of the cables for my USB 2.0 scan disk card reader worked Perfectly.  Then to top it off, the Camera was quickly recognized by my DIY-er computer with Windows 8 and my wife\'s HP Windows 7 Lap Top. I like the view finder. Improvements? 6 or 7x zoom and yes cables but shortcomings/cons are very minimal.',' positive'
'good price and love the viewfinder so I can see to take pictures no matter where the sun is.  good camera',' positive'
'I bought it specifically for Optical eye level viewfinder because most rangefinder cameras now don\'t have it.  The Canon name meant I\'d have great photos too.  The AA batteries are my preference because spares are always available.  It\'s a great little camera to be carried everywhere.',' positive'
'I haven\'t used it yet, I am going to Guadalajara soon and I will use it there.  I\'ll give you full report after that.',' positive'
'Forever a Canon fan. Next camera will be a SLR but for a point and shoot, it is quite simple to operate.simple to operate.',' positive'
'this is the 2nd Canon PowerShot I have owned. Great camera....like the viewfinder when you can\'t see the screen...only point & shoot that has this.',' positive'
'I could not  believe the many controls and features offered by this camera.I have not had a camera since the 70\'s with a AE1 and find this little beautyalmost as good. If you really want to get the most out of it, download the PDFfile instruction manual. It has a wealth of information. I am still trying to use all thedifferent settings and aqm having a ball.',' positive'
'this camera replaces my earlier a 45. I forgot the batteries in it and it went bad.I like it because it is small, light and easy to use',' positive'
'Very easy camera to use.  I was able to use the camera with in minutes.  Battery life and flash are perfect for the novice user.  Great camera!!',' positive'
'Have had it a month or so and no issues unlike the other Canon I bought here last year. Some flaws as others note on reviews, but for the price you cannot go wrong......',' positive'
'when i opened this i thought its soo light  feels like a toy.. then i took some pics with it and omg.. this camera is amazing...  takes great pictures!!  great for the price too',' positive'
'Great camera, features, performance and price! Love the viewer finder in bright light I can see what I\'m shooting, very user friendly controls, love the quick switch from pictures to video with a simple rec. button. The eco-battery saver setting is great got about 25 min HD video and over (80) 16 meg pictures from one charge. Love the AA batteries I use rechargeables, cheap to buy and can get AA batteries anywhere if needed on a trip. The pictures and video are very good.Great Buy!',' positive'
'This was a great camera for me.  I am digitally challenged, and still had no problem figuring out how to use it.  It takes a great photo.  It\'s a little slow, but not enough to make me regret my purchase.  I was VERY happy with the person who wrote the review, about be sure to take the few extra steps needed to get the memory card!  I almost missed that, much appreciated.',' positive'
'I bought this camera for my wife because our other camera is a larger SLR type camera.This camera is the perfect size for carrying in a pocket or purse.As other people have said, the picture and video quality is absolutely excellent as it captures full, vibrant colors.I don\'t see how anybody could regret buying this camera.',' positive'
'2 years ago my daughter broke my wife\'s digital camera screen which made it unusable since it didnt have a viewfinder...and its taken me forever to find a good camera with a viewfinder since almost every company has gone without one...well i got news for ya I\'m a professional photographer and this thing has really nice quality photos... this made my wife\'s Christmas the best ever. if you are an old-school point and shoot person that likes a viewfinder...this is the one for you! it doesn\'t have a ton of bells and whistles but it does the job very very well!',' positive'
'I haven\'t used it much, but it is similar in function to my previous (Canon) camera.  I appreciate the viewfinder, the AA battery power (I use rechargeables and always keep a spare set with the camera) and the SD card.',' positive'
'Love my new camera. It is just what I wanted. Nothing too complicated but easy enough to download photos to my laptop and upload for my work on line. I like being able to resize the photo file if necessary too. It is comfortable to hold with one hand. I appreciated reading all the feedback on the camera before I bought it so I knew to have a memory card and batteries when it arrived.',' positive'
'Yes folks, it\'s just a digital camera.  You can\'t send pictures via WIFi to your computer or your smartphone, tsk tsk...also you can\'t imbed the fact that you are in the jungle at such and such lat and long with a GPS app that saps your battery.  But if you need a second or third camera and a compact one that works and you can tolerate mostly AUTO, this is a keeper.  It\'s small, looks much better than I thought it would, uses AA batteries - I have rechargeable so but it comes with a couple of starter batteries.  For $85, what\'s not to like.  The EVF is small, but useable, and horrors this means you can even use this little camera in sun light.  What will they think of next?  I agree, a few cirques are true.  After flash, it\'s a bit slow to recharge. It\'s not a camera that gives you 800 ISO for low light.  But it fits very easily in a pocket or a purse, and it\'s not bizarrely over engineered like the Panasonic I just bought that\'s basically charming but useless for it\'s presumed main purpose...taking pictures, the ZS 30 at 3+ times the price.',' positive'
'Uses off the shelf batteries available everywhere.  Takes good movies with the push of one button.  Viewfinder window.  Light and small.',' positive'
'The eyepiece is the biggest feature.  You can\'t find one anywhere else unless you pay a lot more.  Camera takes great pictures and its tough.  I slipped and fell in Sicily in September.  Camera flew out of my hand and bounced off two cement walls before it hit the ground.  Nothing worked so I thought it was toast.  I took it back to the hotel and noticed the turret was out of line.  With nothing to lose, I attempted to bend it back.  something went Pop and everything functioned perfectly.  Still running great in December.',' positive'
'I took it along on two vacations. It\'s small and lightweight, and so the camera fit nicely in my purse.',' positive'
'Not high end, but perfect for snaps on the go with no need for the extra gadgetry haul.  It fits nicely in a pocket or purse and the picture quality is actually quite acceptable for someone who likes memories, but is not into needing crystal clear quality that a $700.00 + would provide (been there, done that - not necessary for family memories.)',' positive'
'I am new to picture taking, and this little camera makes me and my pictures look good!.  It was just the right price for a new \"camera bug\" to get started with and it has been easy to use.  The manual is huge (I kept a downloaded copy on my computer)  and I refer to it often and I still have alot to learn, but I believe learning on this is the way to go before spending more on a \"fancier\" camera.  If I become really really good, I may progress to something bigger and better but if I just stay with this, I know I made a good buy. It is easy to load your pictures on line and send to friends and family.',' positive'
'An optical viewfinder is difficult to find in any compact camera.  Although the zoom is only 5x, the camera takes beautiful pictures with superb detail.  I was able to take close ups of several small items, something I wasn\'t able to do with a digital SLR that cost nearly ten times as much as the A1400.  The A1400 is simply fun to use.  For the price Amazon is charging, you also get the great benefit of having a 16 mega pixel camera.',' positive'
'Has many features which make photography much easier.  Not sophisticated enough for aficionados but an very high powered and compact point and shoot camera.  I particularly like the eye level view finder.',' positive'
'Well made and very small to carry.  Takes clear photos and offers a very good zoom.  Uses standard batteries so that is a plus.',' positive'
'nice and easy to use takes really nice pictures for a lower price point I would recommend it for young or older photographers who need something simple',' positive'
'The only modern camera with an optical viewfinder. This is very helpful when I am out in the woods in direct sunlight. The screen is all but invisible, making my other camera useless. And it is a simple-to-use Canon A-series. Great camera.',' positive'
'I purchased this as a gift for my son and his fiance, for Christmas so I can\'t attest to how it works but they seem to love it.',' positive'
'When you look at the stats and capability of this camera, this is strictly a Canon DSLR T1i or T2i - in a miniature body. Seriously. You can\'t beat this price! I own the T1i and the T4i, and it\'s amazing to see Canon go behind the backs of all these sales and make this small bodied capable camera. Not sure how to take this but I can assure you this; the 16MP Digic 4 processor is a great package for less than $65.00!!',' positive'
'worth every dime,  great pics  easy to use  does go thru batteries ( carry spares) but there AA so they are cheap  and I do take a lot of pics with it at one time , I would get it if you want an inexpensive Canon ,  when it wears out I will get another',' positive'
'This camera is the easiest \"point and shoot\" camera. It\'s high megapixel makes crystal clear pictures and is super small.',' positive'
'I couldn\'t figure out how to change the file size this camera records -- Canon\'s email customer service had the solution in my inbox in less than 24 hours, on a weekend. This model runs on AA batteries, available anywhere, and has an optical eye-level finder that zooms with the lens. These are features I miss in recent digital cameras, but this one has both. The matte surface and general ergonomic layout make this camera easy to handle. Very glad I came across this one.',' positive'
'It meet all my needs.Only complaint that the cord for thecamera did not come with it.It does a great job.',' positive'
'Camera arrived before scheduled delivery, which was great since we wanted to take pics of our daughter\'s first Christmas.The only disappointment, and part of the blame lies with us, no cable or card come with the camera. Just the camera. I am sure somewhere in the product description it states it, but for the price, the camera performs above our expectations.',' positive'
'A easy to operate camera with a fair price, by far a great value.But thats all I want to say!',' positive'
'it IS a Great camera, but whe i bough the camera it say that I will get MEMORY CARD AND AND I DIN\'T GET IT, THATS VERY DESAPOINTED.here is the advertise:Free 8GB Memory Card with the Purchase of This CameraPurchase the Canon PowerShot A1400 and get a free Sandisk 8GB memory card when you buy from Amazon.com.',' positive'
'Settings like no other. And its fool proof but yet great for a more experienced person.. clear pictures plug and play setup on pc  highly recommended!!',' positive'
'Love my new camera.  It is easy for an inexperienced person to use.  Liked the viewfinder in the blazing sun.',' positive'
'This camera is simple to use with outstanding results. It is difficult to take a bad picture with this camera! I would recommend to anyone desiring a practical and simple point and shoot camera.',' positive'
'replaced my powershot A1200 with the A1400 recently and like it so far.  really like the palm-sized body for \"grab shots\" when using my full size DSLRs are not practical or desirable (like last summer in an open market in Tanzania where taking pics of the people is an automatic $1 \"transaction\" per shot.  also like the black body for being even more inconspicuous .',' positive'
'I would highly recommend this little camera. Picture quality is good and very easy to use. Small and compact! Great camera for the price!!',' positive'
'This is the third Canon Power Shot I have purchased.  I purchased this one for my wife before we traveled to Europe.  Because we take many photos out of doors, the view finder is an invaluable feature.  Plus, you never need to worry about a low battery if you just carry a couple spare double A\'s you are always prepared. And the added bonus is that this little camera takes great movies (although the sound could be better).',' positive'
'First, I am so glad Canon provides optical viewfinders on these cameras. It makes shooting in sunny conditions a breeze, no squinting to see faint images on LCD screens.HD video is great. User friendly, quick to learn interface. I didn\'t read any manuals and I was using all the features within 30 minutes. The close up macro shooting came  on automatically when I got extra close to a flower - - - Outstanding! The image stabilization working fine. Its a powerhouse camera that is small, but still has a firm grip and heft. Fits in my pockets. Has a tripod bushing and a help button. This is the result of years of experience and refinements in digital camera design and I took great care in selecting this camera, and it has turned out to be a success!My only suggestion is the 4-way navigation ring have better tactile properties so I can feel the right position with my finger, sometimes I hit the ring and interior button in the wrong place.',' positive'
'Camera met my most important expectation. Runs on AA batteries. Not a fan of battery packs as they are sometimes hard to replace and require recharging.',' positive'
'It is a great camera with a lot of features. It uses standard AA batteries, no need to carry a charger and wait for the battery to charge. Just throw in 2 new batteries (available anywhere) and keep on shooting.',' positive'
'I purchased this camera for my husband on my first order and was so impressed with the quality of pictures and video I had to order me one.  I haven\'t used mine yet since I already have a working camera and I have been no where to take pictures.  The shipping was fast and the price was great.',' positive'
'Just came back from a trip to Peru.  Love the AA batteries.  Using Lithium batteries, my wife only needed to change batteries once while taking approximately 1500 pictures.  Camera is very lightweight.  It isn\'t the smallest camera available (due to AAs) but still easy to fit in pocket or small camera bag.The only complaints I have relate to the multi-function button-wheel on the back.  First, the wheel is slightly recessed and it was a bit challenging to make selections with my fingers.  My wife didn\'t have any problems.  Secondly, we often pressed the flash selection button when pulling the camera out of its case.  This caused several times where we accidentally activated the flash when not needed, then had to wait a few seconds for the recharge before we could take the next picture.Overall, a great little camera.  I also purchased the SX160IS for myself and liked it better (it is an incredible deal for only $50 more), but the A1400 is a terrific choice for a small, lightweight, travel camera.',' positive'
'This is a great little camera if you consider the price and what it does. I could have gotten the cheaper A2500 model but I stuck with this one because of the design which has a better hand  grip and the viewfinder unlike the flat a2500 which easily slip out of one\'s hands. Also feature wise , there isn\'t much difference between the a2500 and a1400 Picture quality is good for the camera but it does struggle in low light settings. it was also quite surprisingly small and can fit in a chest pocket. video recording quality is good at 720p HD recording  with excellent audio recording and playback. it is relatively easy to setup and can just leave it on auto to do it own thing. There are so many settings to toy with ,experiment and configure to get the desired effect. All in all ,I am enjoying my new camera and hope it stay functional. Canon has made and excellent point and shoot camera I implore people to buy it if you need a portable camera.',' positive'
'Just got this camera and took it on a cruise.  Like all Canon cameras (I\'ve had many) it is easy to operate and takes great pictures.  I got this one for times when I want a small camera that fits well in my purse, and I don\'t need a big zoom.  Best of all, it has a viewfinder.  This was great when I was out in the sun and trying to frame a shot.  Also uses AA batteries, which is my preference.  All in all a nice camera that I will enjoy using.',' positive'
'my daughter loves this it was a Christmas present and she is always taking pictures with it really clear pictures',' positive'
'Its a great camera. Great quality. Its also the perfect size not too big but not too small. I would recomend it its all i wanted.',' positive'
'This camera is very good. Takes great pictures and is very easy to use. Nice and small that fits in your pocket.',' positive'
'just had a new addition to family...now we can have great quality memories every step she makes...she loves the camera already',' positive'
'Just enough \"bells & whistles\" for me.  Looked at quite a few reviews before I purchased this camera.Now I know I chose the right one!!  Great camera for the price!!!',' positive'
'Very easy to operate.  Pictures are great.  Battery life is good. For a point and click camera it\'s perfect. I love it.',' positive'
'Our only camera was malfunctioning right when we needed it. We prefer a camera with a viewfinder for the many times the screen is washed out by our bright sunshine. We also needed  some basic adjustability for photos used to sell products online.There are very few basic cameras with a viewfinder. I\'ve been very happy with my previous Canon, so we ordered this one. It was a great price, more features than we need, and smaller and lighter than the previous camera.It arrived quickly. We are very happy.',' positive'
'Paid around $70 for this great little camera. So far it has been awesome, great quality shots and easy to use. Got it as a Christmas present and they have been extremely pleased with it. I would recommend for someone wanting a basic, easy to use point and shoot camera.',' positive'
'I bought this camera just because I like taking pictures that look nice! It takes great pictures and how can you beat that for only $58',' positive'
'Gave this to my wife as a Christmas gift and she seems to really like it.  I used it and was very satisfied with the quality and ease of use.  Picture quality is just as good as a more expensive Canon that we own.',' positive'
'Perfect camera to send with my son out of the country.  He does not have to worry about charging batteries in Ukraine or the different voltages of electricity.  He can just throw in a new set of batteries and he is off and running.  It is also surprisingly small and fits right in his pocket.  I like the programs and how easy it is to use.  I highly recommend this camera.  I am thinking of getting one for myself.  It is better than my camera on my phone and just as portable.  Nice job Cannon.',' positive'
'This camera met or exceeded all my expectations.  It is compact, light, and easy to use. The fact that it uses aa batteries was an important factor for me, because they are readily available & easily replaced. The screen is large & bright.  Price was below $100.',' positive'
'I chose this camera for two main reasons -- it has a viewfinder and uses AA batteries. I bought it to replace another Canon camera that was stolen.I\'m very happy with my new camera. It\'s very easy to use. I downloaded the manual from the Canon website, and learned all about it. I\'m especially pleased with the movie function. I shot a couple of great scenes with my parrot. It was very easy to use. I\'m very happy with this camera.',' positive'
'Exceeds the capabilities of the Olympus we\'ve had for years and is much easier to use. really a user freindly camera',' positive'
'Easy to use if you are not a \'techie\'.  The pictures are sharp and clear and it almost fits in a pocket.',' positive'
'Easy to use. Has viewfinder to use on sunny days when you can\'t see picture on the screen. Lots of features for an inexpensive camera.',' positive'
'easy to use, easy to download pix with a usb cable or simply pull the SD card, excellent quality pix.  Love the viewfinder, love the fact it uses AA batteries, love the zoom, love the video capability.  Took it on a trip to France, and came home with excellent pix.  THANKS for a top quality little camera.  Bought a caribiner clip camera bag that fits it perfectly, and the camera hangs from my purse.  Easy peasy....',' positive'
'It\'s an awesome point and shoot camera, and my wife and I love it. We weren\'t looking for something professional, we just wanted a good camera that would capture our memories well. Takes really good pictures - especially outside. We absolutely love it!',' positive'
'A view finder in bright light is a must for me. Now I can see exactly what I\'m taking a picture of. Takes great pictures; is compact and light weight.',' positive'
'I have been a FILM photographer for many, many years. This Canon is the Perfect Camera to begin the Transition from FILM Cameras to All Digital. It\'s affordable, the perfect size & very Easy to use. The Images are Superb, with or without using the Flash. This begins my journey to the transition to a  Professional 35mm DIGITAL Camera.',' positive'
'Used this camera on many hiking trips, dropped several times with no damage incurred, it is a solid value for the cost, light weight, easy to operate. Photo\'s are high definition, easy to make a copy on a CD-R of your recent adventure with the date on your pictures. It makes many memories stay alive!',' positive'
'I would recommend to anyone that wants quality pictures without a lot of camera set up and adjusting.I just view image on LCD and shoot and walla a great looking picture. If you don\'t have one, buy one,you\'ll  love it!',' positive'
'The camera is simple to use.  I am not a photographer and I wanted a camera that was easy to use for basic pictures.  I am pleased with my purchase.  If you want just a basic digital camera, this could fit your needs.',' positive'
'My son is enjoying his new camera even tho the flash Memory card did not come with our order.  Thank you',' positive'
'I\'m not familiar with all the technicalities of digital cameras, so I\'ll leave that to the other reviewers. I needed a basic point-and-shoot for a service trip, and this fit the bill. I wasn\'t expecting much, given its price ($70), but found that the pictures are crisp and clear, with vivid colors even prior to any editing jobs. Image stabilization was good, and I liked the battery compartment - it\'s convenient when you don\'t have electricity, and the slight bulge on the front helps with shaky hands. The camera itself is a good size, actually; I was expecting something a lot bigger due to the battery compartment, but it\'s petite and classy! All in all, a worthy buy; if your expectations don\'t greatly exceed the price, you\'ll be very pleased.',' positive'
'I gave my girlfriend this camera for Christmas as her Kodak broke. She wanted something simple that would take decent photos she could print, and she had no computer. I have 3 Canons myself and always pleased with them. While I was showing her how to set it up, I found it had many features my current ones didn\'t, such as 16MP photos, 5X zoom etc. So I bought a 2nd one for myself and WOW, so much power in such a little device. What impressed me most was the HD video. It will be my shirt-pocket pal for quite awhile. The price and the free 8GB card were both bonuses. I was disappointed with the lack of instructions so went to my favorite manual printer, manualsink.com and purchased a 124 page copy. I am a frequent customer of theirs and very satisfied.',' positive'
'Now we or talking, this camera I really fell in love with not to heavey what I may call just right order so Thank yall for this one',' positive'
'Bought this for my dad on christmas, he loves it! it has 5x zoom and the picture quality is great!',' positive'
'Love this camera and in spite of no Sd memory card as claimed , it does exactly what I wanted it to do takes nice pictures.',' positive'
'This is an excellent camera... very user friendly and takes fabulous pictures... crystal clear... I would recommend this to anyone!!',' positive'
'We were looking for a small camera with an eye piece as well as a screen because it is often very difficult to view the subject on the screen on a sunny day.',' positive'
'I\'ve used PowerShot series of cameras professionally since the A550.  The A1400 is the best so far with stunning resolution,ease of operation and the eye-friendly viewfinder. The focusing screen is not enough when the lighting is wrong. A longer optical zoom range on the next in the A series would be a big plus. I recommend it to all my students.',' positive'
'This camera is very easy to use.  The sight through the eye piece is much easier to use in sunlight than the screen on the back.  The instructions are extensive and easy to read and apply.',' positive'
'Photos are clear and crisp, very brilliant !!  I am very happy with the quality of picture I am getting with this camera. We hit a large bump while snapping mtn range photo and it came out beautiful ! Def recommend for easy point, zoom and shoot.',' positive'
'The only concern I have is it\'s durability. I use this in my job frequently and need it to hold up. Only time will tell but I hope I get at least 4-5 years out of it.',' positive'
'I bought this camera for my mom to replace the very complicated high-end digital camera I bought for her last year.  This camera is perfect for older folks, the camera is easy to hold, has large power on/off, shuttle, video and playback buttons.  The zoom dial is also perfectly oversize for older people with less dexterity.  Also the camera uses two AA batteries which is just simple and so much easier for taking on trips.I highly recommend this for senior citizens.',' positive'
'I bought this as an \"intermediate\" camera - - in between my cell phone and 30:1 digital zoomer. It fits in a big pocket, or in a small belt pouch - take your choice. (Since I was traveling in pick-pocket areas, I put it in my pocket and kept my hand in my pocket too.)I am VERY pleased. It comes on almost instantaneously, and it also focuses quickly and shoots fast, recovering in less than a second for the next shot.Film speed is good, defaults to 1600. Not exactly for night photography, but low-light is no problem at all.The viewfinder (thanks Canon) is for me indispensable, since LED screens are so hard to see in daylight (not to mention having to get out my reading glasses). I wish other vendors would add the viewfinder back in, but Canon seems to be the last holdout.Another thing I REALLY like for traveling is the AA batteries. Yeah, you have to buy batteries, but you do not have to carry a charger around (and of course forget to charge your spare battery, as we all will eventually do). This only uses two AA\'s, and they last a LONG time, maybe 500-1000 (non-flash) photos or thereabouts.Highly recommended.',' positive'
'I am very happy with this camera.  I like to take a camera when I go out hiking and this is perfect.  Small enough to fit in my pocket, very easy to use, long battery life and the picture quality is very good.  So far all the pictures I\'ve taken with this camera have been great.And I like that it runs on standard batteries, I can always carry spare batteries.  It does not have an included usb cable but that is not a minus for me since I have four already.My only gripe is that the case is plastic, a metal case would have been better.',' positive'
'The HD recording is very nice as long as it\'s not too zoomed in. The camera is VERY Light and compact. Battery life isn\'t too glorious but then again it\'s just 2 AA batteries. The charging flash can be annoying but it\'s a FANTASTIC camera for the money',' positive'
'My wife really liked it.  It\'s small so she can carry it with her most of the time and it uses readily available AA batteries.',' positive'
'Does what I want it to do. Pure and Simple. Love that it has more than just the screen to see what you are taking for a picture.',' positive'
'got it as a replacement for my Kodak EasyShare Z1485 IS Digital Camera  i been using for years like fact its bare bones point an shout to go along with my Canon EOS T3i good for fast shot nice bit of sating for fast use  were you cant get the big DSLR out also can take the 32GB SD cards as will adds  to the canon hardware i have',' positive'
'A pocket-able camera with a view finder made by Canon and selling for less than $100?Upon opening the box, I was pleasantly surprised that I could grab it from multiple angles without activating any controls. Next I was surprised to see the batteries did not make the unit uncomfortably side heavy. The flash is thankfully not a popup. The larger recessed power button and indented battery compartment cover were large enough that I didn\'t have to aim unduly with my large fingers.  The start up and lag times were better than I dared hope. The operating controls kept the same Canon theme. The news just kept getting better as I continued exploring.As for the quality of pictures and it\'s ability to shoot in low light situations? Very good, especially in low light.',' positive'
'I saw one that my wife had bought for high school journalism and had to have one. It takes great pictures, sure not up to bigger cameras but not that far off either. I don\'t understand some of the critical comments such as poor pictures in low light.  I just finished  a set in a museum that didn\'t allow flash and they were fine. As regards the flash, I counted 5 seconds to recharge and take another picture. I consider that acceptable. With any camera you need to watch the battery usage. Turn down the LED display or better yet use the viewfinder and allow time for the batteries to tecover or carry extra batteries for All in all a great supplemental camera which may be all that some people will require.',' positive'
'I just wanted something to record hikes and so on. Homemade porn if the opportunity comes around. It will serve in either case.I\'m not Consumer Reports. Anyway, if you want to be Ansel Adams may need to drop more bucks. Or be a war photographer. If you want to do that you would better served spending way more money on a shrink.It takes fine photos. I could use less menu options. Same reason I don\'t want a smart phone. I want to take a picture. I want to make a phone call. I am not revolving my life around gadgets.',' positive'
'This camera gives perfect digital pictures for such a small camera.The zoom was very good for a trip to the Grand Canyon.Keep the strap around your wrist to avoid dropping camera.I recommend this camera very highly.',' positive'
'Nice Camera and great quality pictures. Very easy to use and figure out. Small and light weight. The thing that surprised me about the camera which i missed when i ordered it is that it uses 2 AA batteries, which totally works for me because i hate having to wait for batteries to charge. It does not have a USB connection because i guess you have to download the pictures directly from the SD Card. Not a big deal. Overall its a decent inexpensive camera that takes quality pictures and video.Not that everyone uses this option but you can shut off the lcd and use the small lens to take pictures that way too.',' positive'
'For a point and shoot camera, it is very light weight and easy to use.  When I set the camera to mute and no flash, it held that setting until I changed it even though I turned the camera off and on. The zoom is easy to use.  The viewing screen is a nce size.  The photos I have taken so far, have turned out great.',' positive'
'So far the camera  works very well.  It is simple to use which is what I was looking for. I downloaded the manual which was very helpful.  I would recommend this camera.',' positive'
'I was looking for a camera that I could used in a hurry. At my age I want to record vacation memories. I was not looking for a camera to take professional photos. I am very well pleased with the Canon Powershot A100. Though surprised at how small it is, its size was an asset, easily fitting into pockets and purse. The AA battery life was very good and 2 AA batteries are easy to find and carry as backup. It has a view finder as well as a digital screen, and the photos are wonderful.',' positive'
'This camera takes great photos, and the price can\'t be beat! Great to take along when the \"big camera\" would be too cumbersome.',' positive'
'I hand these out to my technicians. It\'s so easy to use and to download the pictures to the computer!! I love these Powershot cameras.',' positive'
'I love the viewfinder--I can take photos in the bright sun when others are forced to guess.  My only problem is that indoors it can take a long time for the flash to go off.  Still, I really like it and the photos are excellent.',' positive'
'If you are looking for a great little economical camera this is it.  Love the AA Battery feature...no charger to take along on trips. You can buy backup batteries almost anywhere.  For a AA camera it has a long battery life.  I am using rechargables I bought on Amazon. The complaint about the plastic camera body made me laugh.  My $1200.00 Olympus Mr Bulky is all plastic so is the interior on my $40,000.00 Pickup. So why expect more from a $100.00 camera. The only comlaint is that the SD card is in the same compartment as the AA batteries. Not a deal breaker for me, but kind of inconvenient.  Photos are excellent, sharp bright colors.  I didn\'t buy this for the video feature however it has better sound quality than my wifes $500.00 camcorder.  I was amazed. Love the telephoto viewfinder feature. If you are looking for an economical, take along camera that does a decent job this is it.',' positive'
'Being able to use the view finder and turning off the back screen saves batteries.  If you do need to change batteries this camera uses standard AAs that are available everywhere.  The 5x zoom is great and more adaptable than a phone or tablet camera.  The size of the camera is great.  Fits in a pocket with ease.',' positive'
'The only non-SLR camera on the market that still has an optical viewfinder...LED screens just don\'t cut it when your shooting pictures outdoors!',' positive'
'Purchased this for an elderly parent who is \"scared\" of digital cameras and must use a view finder rather than the lcd screen because of poor eye sight.  I had significant requirements which were: (1) easy to operate \"point and shoot\" camera; (2) view finder and (3) replaceable AA batteries (so no worries if someone forgets to recharge the battery--because it\'s not a rechargeable battery camera).  (4) light weight (5) small camera. This fits the requirements perfectly.  Seriously, stick an SD card and batteries in it and start taking pics. No learning curve required.  If you want rechargeable batteries, remember they are available in size AA. It does have an lcd screen too if you want to use it instead of the view finder.  Could not be happier with this purchase.  It came super quickly too.',' positive'
'I was looking for a good camera for our trip to Disneyland over Christmas break.  I looked on Amazon and I found it.  Just the right size to.  Easy to carry around on our trip.',' positive'
'Great pic quality!  Easy to use and I can use rechargeable AA batteries! No need to buy expensive proprietary batteries.  Also, a rare camera to have an optical viewfinder at a low price.  I don\'t think you will get better pics from paying more - I know, I use Canon DSLRs 50D, 30D with L lenses.Great camera, great price, get one!',' positive'
'I used to have a Nikon Coolpix, I liked it but had some issues it didn\'t last long. I replaced it with this canon and haven\'t had any issues. It works well, great battery life, handy size, quality pictures, user friendly. I lost the first canon I had and this is my second one.',' positive'
'When you get older, those so and so view screens, no matter how large, are a pain. They wash out in sunlight and we seniors must put on our reading glasses to even view them. Finally someone came out with a lower end camera with an optical finder! The camera is for my wife who wanted a simple to operate camera with reasonable picture quality. This was it and for only $79, a steal in my experience. We highly recommend this for anyone wanting a compact, versatile, and dependable camera for those \"snapshots\".',' positive'
'very good pictures, very durable, gentle with the batteries(simple AA last forever), I\'m using it with rechargeable,- very happy with it.',' positive'
'Shipping was efficient. Great product for such a good price. I purchased a 32g, 45mb SD Card and it works well with the camera.',' positive'
'I am not very techie and I can handle this camera just fine.  It makes good pictures.  It seems very sturdy.',' positive'
'Good camera for my husband who wants simple controls, AA batteries so we don\'t worry about trying to charge in the middle of the day and lightweight.  Also helps that it takes good pictures!  It is getting harder and harder to find cameras that still take AA batteries, so I buy them when I can.',' positive'
'Excellent camera for what was needed and being able to use AA batteries instead of the ones that need to be recharged is a real plus.',' positive'
'Easy to use.  My daughter got one and advised me to get one too.  I need it to document my quilts.',' positive'
'I have always been a fan of Canon and own an XL2 and a T4i but sometimes they stay at home or in the case due to their size and set-up requirements. Having decided to get a point and shoot I quickly decided that the A 1400 was the right choice for me. Easy to learn and use, small enough to fit in a shirt pocket, and powered by AA batteries it makes shooting photos and 720p video a breeze and now I never leave home without it.',' positive'
'I bought this to take to Peru, as mine had died.  I was pretty nervous taking an untested camera on an amazing adventure.  But, it worked great!  The photos are amazing (for a point and shoot).  All my photos turned out great, and the battery life lasted longer than my last camera, which was also a Canon PowerShot.',' positive'
'This is a good little camera for the money. Lot\'s of modes to choose from and they did perform well. I reconend it for a pocket knock around or do what I did buy it for son for his first camera.',' positive'
'I have not had a digital camera for a number of years.  I am very pleased that I chose the PowerShot 1400.  The price is definitely right and it works great.  The manual takes a long time to download (215 pages), but it is worth having.',' positive'
'For the price, it has features of more expensive cameras. Perfect for the advanced beginner. Prefer the fact that it uses AA batteries instead of a battery pack so once you remember to pack some extra AAs, you shouldn\'t miss anything.',' positive'
'Having a camera with a viewfinder makes it so much easier to compose a picture in bright daylight and also makes holding the camera steady much easier than holding a camera with outstretched arms.',' positive'
'The viewfinder and stabilizer are wonderful. You can now see what you are taking a photo off when it is sunny out and you don\'t have to worry about camera settings. Great camera to take anywhere.',' positive'
'I bought four of these (prior version) cameras for school and one for the school auction/dance (auctioned off with 4 hours of my time for photo instruction, etc.).Anyhow - I LOVE these cameras. AA batts so I don\'t have to worry about whether the camera is charged or not. (I have a PowerShot SX210 with two lithium batts, personally. But for school, recharging batts is no good - the cameras might sit on the shelf for a while and lose charge and I don\'t want to buy extra $60 batts for them.)So...kids use them, mostly, to shoot videos. Being able to take the SCCard out of the camera and put it into a small SD Card reader is just so easy. Forget about the USB cable. Most laptops now come with SD slots in them so you can pop the card out of the camera and into your laptop - how much easier is that??I think this is an EXCELLENT --> ENTRY LEVEL <-- camera for kids, particularly; but, really, anyone who wants to start learning about photography. Yeah, it lacks a lot of bells and whistles a lot of the other P&S cameras have, but that\'s GREAT because there is nothing to distract you from learning how to \"see\" a good photo and learn all about the \"photographer\'s eye\".I\'ve also felt that it\'s good not having too much stuff on a device because then you can really learn what you are missing and KNOW what to look for when you\'re ready to move up to the next level.I think a lot of folks \"overbuy\" in a camera, especially, and then either get frustrated with it because there just is too much to learn or, worse, just don\'t use the camera.The price is right - the camera is more than capable of taking great photos. I plan to buy some more for the school.',' positive'
'This is a  very nice portable camera.  It is very nice for road trips in the car and motorcycle.  It takes great pictures.',' positive'
'This camera is more compact tha my other camera that was stolen. I pirchase a cheap camera for $15.00 and was very unhappy with the pictures. Saved for this camera and WOW what a difference. I have purchased Canon cameras for 10 + years and have never been disappointed. Highly recommend purchasing for the ease of use for those of us that just want to take pictures.',' positive'
'best camera I have ever had. I love the features, the pictures are very clear and it\'s easy to use.',' positive'
'Easy to handle, solid but lightweight.. Compact just like all other brands but have easy to use viewfinder on those bright days. I was pleasantly surprised with this camera and I love it! Great crisp photos. Would recommend this to everyone that likes point & shoot cameras.',' positive'
'I would recommend this product still need to use it more for further evaluation at this time after my summer vacation',' positive'
'I bought this camera for when I don\'t want the weight of my SLR and when the weather could damage it. Great photos. Easy to use.',' positive'
'I bought this camera because of the described features - regular batteries, HD movies as easy as pressing a button, the extra small eye for glare-free steady focus.  To supplement my camera, I ordered a 16GB memory card, the recommended case, the 2-year protection plan and after a little research, the designated USB cable: (which with shipping cost $10.74). After trying it out on a skiing trip I was pleased with the fast shooting, the long battery life, true colors and textures. Awesome camera!',' positive'
'This camera is an absolute dream to use. So simple from the first time picking up. Point and shoot. All there is to it. Takes beautiful pictures. I really enjoy using it. Would defiantly buy again!',' positive'
'I bought this camera for my wife, it\'s her first digital product. Couldn\'t be easier for a beginner.Takes great pictures. Preview button for pictures is a nice feature.Nice size, good price.',' positive'
'We bought this to replace a point and shoot that we lost in Florida while on vacation.  There are very few point and shoots with two ways to look at the subject of your photo.  This camera has that option which I really like when the sun is shinning full blast and you can\'t see the screen at the back of the camera. Now we can look through the viewfinder and do it that way.  The pictures are great and the quality is excellent.  Would highly recommend this camera.',' positive'
'Came with no usb cable for computer upload or any mention of it in there add, plus no software to make it all work except another web site that wants to charge you  $4.00 to down load it to your computer. What a rip off !!--Amazon used to be on top of things like this,Oh well looks like all things go to the dogs eventualy or corprate profits for bonuses.-- Wont be Fooled again.JJ Pryce',' positive'
'I owned a previous version of the camera and really liked it.  I wanted to get the same kind with a viewfinder.  I am so glad they still made this with a viewfinder!  Great feature for really sunny days.  This camera is smaller than my previous version which I love.  It takes excellent pictures!  I like it so much I bought three others for family members.',' positive'
'We gave this to my daughter for Christmas, but here we are -- in mid March and the camera is broken.  Didn\'t even last 4 months.  We\'re so disappointed, as is she.  Received lens error, now massive clicking sounds.  This one is a mess.  Wouldn\'t recommend.',' negetive'
'My Canon Powershot camera was $59. I needed a cheap camera fast and I got mine within two days. The charger plugged directly into the wall with a place for the battery to sit. So far so good. But unlike all other cameras I have bought, it did not even come with a starter memory card. When I took a picture, it told me \"Cannot Record.\"  And there was no USB cable to connect to my computer either. That\'s a new one for me too.I repeat there is no memory card and no USB cord, so you can neither take a picture nor view it.But it did say in the book that there was a \"*power cord,\"(asterisk included) written in smaller font on the starter page under Package Contents. But there was no such thing. Then under the first step, \"Charging the Battery, \" it tells you to, \"Plug the power cord into the charger, then plug the other end into a power outlet.\" I was able to charge my battery without this power cord. It was only by using a powerful light that I could see that on the back of my battery charger was the model number inscribed as CB-2LF, and I did not need this power charger. Such needless aggravation.I have a wee website in which I am Amazon affiliate and I was going to write a review. But it looks like that will have to wait until the add-ons I ordered today come in. So much for trusting Amazon to give me the full low-down. It should come with a huge caution sign for buyers, especially at this price. These things do add up. How can you make a price/feature comparison if you have to calculate so many variables? Furthermore, a camera at this price, might be  for a gift, and the gift recipient would be pretty bummed if they had to order additional items just to make the Canon Powershot A2500 work.The bigger problem will be when I get the memory card and the proper USB cord, what happens if I don\'t like the picture of the camera or how it functions? Will the aftermarket companies allow me to send back their products and get a refund that includes the shipping cost? It would have been so much more convenient for Canon to sell a complete package.I guess  learned my lesson. The product description on Amazon gave the features of the camera. But it did not list what came in the box. I should have read through each review and customer Q & A to glean what was still needed to make this camera fully operable.If this were a car it would be missing its steering wheel, and other car stuff, which I can\'t think of the analogies, because I am so frustrated.But there are three nice things I can tell you: The cherry red is easy to spot in a dark purse and it is very, very light weight. And one kind person on this site Ricky Lorda, answered my question about the USB from the ask customer section of this page, saying that it did come with a USB cord (although as I mentioned, mine did not), and that was very nice of him to give me his quick response.',' negetive'
'Very disappointed in customer service. The camera said it came with free SD card and free case but when I received it there was no SD card or case so I called and they said I was suppose to click on learn more and then check those items but it said it cost for those items so I didn\'t click on them cause I thought I was getting them free. When I called customer service said they could not send the SD card or case. Very misleading, I\'m a very good customer but that didn\'t matter. So I would not buy this item for that reason.',' negetive'
'I purchased this Canon based upon reviews found on the web.  I compared the picture quality by using 2 cameras taking the exact same picture at the exact same time then comparing the results.  The other camera was my Canon SX110 purchased in 2008.  I was looking for a \"better\" camera, more pixels, better resolution...  Not nearly as good and I wanted better.  I wouldn\'t recommend this for kids to use as a toy.',' negetive'

This was the first digital camera I ever purchased. When I opened the box there was no disc for my computer. I\'m not one to download info from a web site. So I decided to return it. In my case it would be best for me to go to a camera store and get personal  advice form a sales person.',' negetive'

'The camera that I received does not work. The image is totally blurred on the screen, probably a CCD issue. It is useless.',' negetive'
'The low light capabilities are not good at all. The shutter speed lags significantly and if I were taking pictures of my little nephews or dormmates being silly, the pictures would all come out blurry. The turn-on time was slower than expected. Half a second makes a big difference in my opinion. The camera took too long to focus and often times did not focus on the proper subject. I did only take shots in my dorm room, but the lights were on. Maybe if I took pictures in the daytime outdoors, the quality of the pictures would have been better.The color is a very nice red and it was very light and small, but it felt so cheap because of the plastic shell. I returned it and bought the Canon Elph 330, which I like a heck of a lot better.Would not recommend or buy again.',' negetive'

It shuts off if you don\'t take a picture right away, the image stabilization (which is one of the reasons I purchased this camera) is horrible the picture is always blurry or out of focus and the Auto feature is slow to pick up anything or won\'t change to the correct feature.I would not recommend this camera to anyone and wish that I had gotten a different camera.',' negetive'

'After exactly 250 shots, my D600 completely shut down.  No power, no response to anything.Up until that point (first 3 days with it), it was awesome.  The pictures were fantastic, editing the RAW images was fine using ViewNX2 that came with it.  I did have to uninstall my older version of ViewNX2 to get it to work.  But no real issues there.The video was outstanding as well.  Love the mic input.But none of that really matters when it stops working.  The battery is fully charged, it is just behaving as though it has no power.I was so excited to receive this camera.  This is just so darn disappointing.***UPDATE***New D600 arrived yesterday (Tuesday).  After letting the battery get a full charge, it appears to be working fine.  I tested the non-working D600 just to see if it was a faulty battery, and it was not.  The original D600 still showed no signs of life even with the new battery that was powering a working D600.  So The issue does appear to be in the camera.Amazon\'s purchase and return experience has been fantastic, and deserves mention.  When I pre-ordered it they sent me an email from a \"camera concierge\", letting me know that someone was going to be watching my order and making sure it was delivered on time.  It was delivered on the date they said it would when I pre-ordered.  So Sunday morning, I sent them an email explaining the failure on Saturday night.  I received a call back from them a few hours later.  I explained the issue, and after no longer than a 5 minute phone call, Amazon had my replacement on the way.  It arrived on Tuesday (yesterday), and UPS will pick up the non-working D600 at my house on Wednesday (today).  I don\'t often return things, but I have to say this is probably the best exchange experience I\'ve had so far.  Amazon made this very easy for me.  So thank you to them.  They deserve 5 stars.*** Second Update ***My replacement D600 started having memory card issues after 50 or so shots, it read -E- for the memory card in slot one, I popped out the card, and popped it back in and it worked fine for another hundred or so shots.  This happened 4 times, then stopped happening and it worked fine for about 500 shots after that.  There were no issues with slot 2.  When I swapped cards between slot and 2, the issue stayed with slot 1.  If it were a memory card issue, I would have expected to see that error appear for slot 2 after a while, but it never did.This combined with my previous experience has me very concerned about the quality of this camera.  I returned it today.  Once again, Amazon was great, UPS picked up the camera from my house today, and Amazon will issue a full refund.',' negetive'
'It is just incredible how Nikon could not solve and support loyal users. The D7000 was a disaster about oil spoils in sensor, they did not solve the problem and refuse to recognize it, they did it again with the D7100 and now my D600 has the same problem! I can just say it is unfair and time will say, but I anticipate a lot like me will at the end refuse to accept the arrogant Nikon atitude.  It would help, a lot, that Nikon could know about this three words, loyalty, honesty and humility. They just do not look the way I think Japanese are. On the other side, Sony is coming, the A7 is here, cheeper, nicer, lighter and without any problem, at least my Sony Nex 7 has been working great without any problem, so as I use to say, to the time!!!',' negetive'

'I bought the D600 about a year ago and since then the camera presents the evil dust oil issues. The issue was not resolved after sensor cleaning, actually it got worst making the camera completely useless. The first few pictures I took with the camera (less than 1,800) were amazing but the oil issues ruined the others after. I\'m pretty sure that the replacement (D610) have the potential to be a great camera as the D600 but just the fact that Nikon didn\'t want to acknowledge the issue and provide the right solution is unacceptable. They know that even cleaning the sensor is not the solution. Many D600 customer has been complaining that after multiple sensor cleaning and even \"change in sensor\" (done at a Nikon Center) the camera recur in the same dust-oil issues. Please my concern is for those that are about to buy the new D610 after my experience with the D600...what are the guarantee that you have as a customer that Nikon will take care of any problem that you can possibly face with a $2,000 camera? Right now many D600 owners (including me) have a camera that not only is useless but because of this issue it can be resell. The right solution will be to replace the D600 for the\"new\" D610 to those that like me have a $2,000 useless camera in a bag. Please Nikon be responsible and be more customer conscious, if you really know what business is and value your customers.',' negetive'

'Nikon has finally admitted to the well-documented problems with spots on the D600 sensor.  Look at sites like dpreview, lens rentals, and the reviews here and you will see this is a real and serious problem.My D600 was sent in for service three times and was not fixed, so they do not have a solution for it yet.  I was getting spots on my sensor every 200 shots and these spots would not come off with a rocket blower.  It is not acceptable to have to clean one\'s sensor that often.  One can not even get through a casual day of photographing, let alone if one was using this camera professionally.  I gather that camera sensors might need to be cleaned every 10,000 or so shots, but NOT every 200, that is unacceptable.The D600 has the potential to be an amazing camera, but DO NOT BUY it until Nikon fixes the underlying cause of the spots problem.  When you do buy it, I recommend buying from Amazon, an authorized Nikon dealer and also a great company who stood behind me, their customer.  5 stars to Amazon, 0 stars to the D600.',' negetive'

Spots all over the top left.I had an argument and a half with Nikon and their \'courtesy clean\' which of course does not fix the issue. The D610 came out within 12 months this was such a major problem.If you like the camera just pay the extra and get a new D610 but don\'t buy the D600, its a lot of money on something that will leave you with photos that are useless.  There are a ton of these on ebay now because people can\'t get Nikon to swap them out for the D610 which they should as its effectively the same replacement camera.',' negetive'
'I thought that I had a clean camera, but it was not the case. I bought the D600 from B&H. After about 3000 actuations, I saw spots which appear like grease or oil on the photos (about 40-50 spots). I tried to use the rocket bowler to clean the sensor but the spots were still there.  I had to send it to Nikon for sensor cleaning, no questions asked.  Very disappointed in this camera and the way Nikon is handling this.',' negetive'
'I have shot with Nikon for many years (since 1976). I\'ve also owned 3 other digital bodies and 3 film, I consider myself a very serious amateur photographer. I was looking forward to the full frame D600 even before the release and spent $2095 buying the body which I paired with Nikon\'s new 28 - 85 mm lensThe first thing I noticed was that after a long shooting day (over 500 images), when I downloaded files in bridge was very visible spots (appeared to be oil) on the sensor. The dust spots continued to get worse and at the point of my images were impossible to use I returned my camera to the store where I purchased the store cleaned my sensors and reported that all was well.  In less than 500 shots the dust returned.  I again returned the camera to the store and was told there was nothing else they could do except return the camera back to Nikon for service.  Now, I am without a camera for a minimum of six weeks and have no grantee that the problem will be resolved.I have called Nikon customer service and was told that these isolated cases are being handled case by case and that what you read on the internet are not necessary true.  I also received an email from Nikon with the same response.  Man up Nikon.There seems to me a manufacturing issue which is causing the spots to appear in the pictures after 150+ or so shots.  At this point I am not recommending to anyone that they purchase this or any other Nikon product.I am very disappointed the product and have been told that there were no widespread problems.  So a camera that owned less than three months and spent $2095 on, in addition to $600 for a lens is defective.Nikon needs to:  offer a free solution and acknowledge there is a problem.',' negetive'
'I am on my second D600 body. The first one was purchased here on Amazon next week after the camera launched. The dust accumulated after first 100 shots and some of the particles would not go away even after the Rocket Air blower was used several times. The dust spread out very quickly (not just in the upper left corner) and after 2000 shots, the ENTIRE sensor was covered with spots, over 10 of which were visible at F4 and a couple at F2.8. Returned the camera, waited a month or so and got another one. After first 5 shots - several spots appeared. Serial # starts with 3031XXX. After another 2000 pictures taken, it seems to be worse then the first body. Some of the spots are REALLY large and I cannot blow them away. Do not want to do the wet clean myself and not willing to be without the camera for 2-3 weeks and deal with horrible Nikon service (most recently had my Speedlight SB-800 serviced, could not get it back from them for a month - awful experience!) Have to shoot a wedding today, I will use my F1.4 and F1.8 optics to avoid visible spots. This is absolutely unacceptable and disturbing. This was my dream-come-true camera. I loved the weight of it, the feel, the features, the image quality...  I feel so frustrated with this problem!!!I was considering D800, but because of the file size and possible left AF problem decided against it.So... Now what? I have recently invested in bunch of Nikon lenses and really love them. I really want this camera to work and will probably give another D600 one more shot. I will update this review and change it to 5 stars, once they fix this REAL problem at the manufacturing level.',' negetive'
'The Nikon D600 has either design or manufacturing flaws of the oil dust on its sensor. You will have pictures with many tiny black dots.

Next camera had the exact same issue. They offered me a third camera but by this point I\'d done enough research to know I could be playing this game awhile.  So I exchanged and upgraded to the D800E. So glad I did plus the extras I bought for the D600 work with the D800E.',' negetive'
'Wow Nikon has always been my camera of choice and I have the D800 as well, had the D90, D7000, D7100 then jumped up to the D800 and now this..... But after maybe 500 shots I had dirt on the sensor or my D60 so I just hoped it was normal, forked over the $75 and got it cleaned. Now after 150 shots or less I have even more crap on the upper part of my sensor with just this small number of shots. Never took my lens off outside and clean conditions. My guess, my camera that I purchased here at Amazon on Aug 7th is another one that has this issue with the gap around the shutter. I am trying to get Amazon to flex its muscles and get me a refund because I surely don\'t want to deal with Nikon and the way they have handled this whole situation. If not for the residue on the sensor the D600 rocks. But thats not my reality nor the camera I paid $2000 for. Just get the D610.

'I am very disappointed with the way NIKON has handled this entire D600 fiasco.  I can best alert you against this camera by copying the words from a recent review.  These are not my words but serve as a good guide.  I hope NIKON will read this and be very ashamed.  I was very lucky because I was able to return the entire D600 camera kit to Costco after I pleaded with them and showed them how this camera is defective and NIKON will not face up to it and instead kicked the consumer in the gut by correcting the problem with the introduction of D610, instead of doing the morally ethical thing of recalling the D600s.  I too noticed the oil and dirt spots on my pictures.  The following is taken from[...] :Here\'s a quote from a Nikon dealer:\"Nikon has devalued our remaining new [D600] inventory and will make it almost impossible for us to sell it off short of taking big losses. We\'re already trying to move our current inventory by taking a $100 hit on the profit side and I don\'t think that\'s going to be enough. If anyone thinks I\'m ordering new D610\'s today (short of specific order requests) they\'re nuts.\"Now let\'s look at things from a well-informed prospective customer viewpoint:  Choice 1: a D600 that might or might not have a shutter issue  Choice 2: a D610 that fixes the shutter issue (to assume otherwise would also be to assume that Nikon is totally incompetent, in which case see Choice 3 ;~)  Choice 3: buy a Canon 6D  Rumored Choice 4: Sony and Pentax introducing competitive full frame camerasWhat I fail to understand is Nikon\'s behavior here. They have done the following by staying quiet about the D600 issues and trying to get around them by doing a sleight of hand with the D610:  Eroded key customer confidence  Devalued a product by their actions, which leads to:  Lowered their product margins  Added another lingering inventory problem, which also leads to lower profit marginsCoupled with all the repair costs that the D600 triggered, how can Nikon\'s response be the right answer to the problem? In retrospect, the proper solution was to recall all D600\'s and examine them for defective shutters. If found, replace it and charge the cost of that replacement to their shutter supplier. That kind of response should have:  Increased key customer confidence  Not devalued the product  Lowered their product margins (cost of shipping cameras, inspecting them)  Not created a lingering inventory problem or the need for another productBut here\'s another new problem I\'m seeing in my In Box. Consider this quote: \"My D600 is coming up on end of warranty. I\'m not a heavy user so I\'m not sure if my camera has the problem. It seems like it needs more cleaning than I expected. What happens when my warranty expires? Will Nikon still replace my shutter for free if it\'s defective?\"Nikon is, as usual, will likely remain silent on such questions, which isn\'t going to increase customer confidence.

'From Nikon in Europes homepage:To users of the Nikon D600 digital SLR cameraThank you for choosing Nikon for your photographic needs.Some users have indicated the appearance of multiple granular dust spots in images captured with the Nikon D600 digital-SLR camera. These granular dust spots are reflections of internal dust generated with camera operation, or external dust particles that have found their way into the camera, either, or both of which, have adhered to the camera\'s low-pass filter.While the structure and concept of digital-SLR cameras makes the complete elimination of these dust spots very difficult, it has come to our attention that, in some rare cases, they may be reflected noticeably in images. Therefore, Nikon is informing users of a service to reduce this issue.ResolutionAs a first step, please follow the guidance from the User\'s Manual (pages 301-305) related to the \"Clean Image Sensor\" function and manual cleaning using a blower. If these measures do not remove all dust particles and you are still experiencing problems, then please consult your nearest Nikon service center. They will keep your camera, examine it thoroughly, and service it as needed.[...]',' negetive'
'Nice fx camera and comfortable in the hand . Great pictures with mid price nikon lens but the spots continue to haunt this model. The sensor after 150 shots has spots on it. When you enlarge a photo is when you can see how bad it is. I waited to order one to end of year thinking the bad ones were returned but no luck, i got a bad one. I don\'t relish having to have the sensor cleaned almost out of the box.',' negetive'
'At $700 off for the kit I was close to buying.  Without that incentive, I am going to wait until they get the internal debris problem fixed.  Nikon seems to use their customers as beta testers.  It seems like every time they come out with a new DSLR it has some kind of problem.  The D70 (which I own) had front/rear focus issues.  It seems like Nikon got around that buy adding focus tuning on the higher end cameras.  Nothing like \"do it yourself\" QA.  The D800 has left/right focus issues.  The D7000 and now the D600 are plagued by \"internal debris.\"  Do some research on Nikon D600 dust/oil.  Hey Nikon, How about some good old fashioned Japanese quality?  I know a lot of this stuff is manufactured in Thailand, but still.  Get it fixed or drop the price again.Added after the initial review:Last week I spent dozens of hours researching the D600, including trying it out in a camera shop. The folks in the camera shop were well aware of the oil/dust issue. I called Nikon USA service and here is what they told me:1) Not all D600 bodies have this issue. Only some do.2) If you purchase a D600 that has the issue Nikon will take care of the problem. They will clean the sensor.3) If the problem recurs, they will clean the sensor again. If they determine that the body can\'t be repaired, they \"will see\" if they can replace it. When asked what \"will see\" means, he said that if it is in stock.4) Nikon has not compiled a list of affected serial numbers.5) Nikon doesn\'t have an understanding of what is causing the problem on some D600 bodies.6) The customer is responsible for the cost of shipping the body to Nikon for the checkout/cleaning.I am sure that this camera takes great photos.  But for $2,000 do you want a camera that may need to go back to Nikon for periodic sensor cleanings?  Nikon, please fix this problem.Added on January 8th:If you want to read more on the internal debris issue, check out the D600 reviews from DPReview, Ryan Brenizer or Thom Hogan.  I\'d post a link, but Amazon doesn\'t allow external URLs.Added on January 10th, 2013:Another place to research this issue is lenrentals.com.  They have an extensive article on the D600 sensor debris issue.  They own dozens of D600 so there experience is based on many D600s, not a single sample.',' negetive'
'I just returned my second D600 due to the sensor spots.  The first one went back 24 hours after I got it.  The camera store people were nice and gave me a replacement, and even checked for sensor spots before it went out the door.  I was there.  We saw nothing.  I got home, did some shooting, checked it the next day, found maybe four or five sensor spots -- to me, that\'s a little soon, but still acceptable.  Today I returned it after a day of shooting, indoors, no dust, one lens change -- and literally dozens of sensor spots.  I made a phone call to Nikon, and the rep told me she\'d never heard of this -- yeah, right.  In the meantime, several other photographer friends are having the same problem.  Nikon clearly has an issue with these.  Things happen, but to pretend it isn\'t, despite widespread reports by photographers, photographic sites, and even camera rental places, is unacceptable.  It\'s a shame, because in all other ways, it\'s a wonderful camera for the price, full of features, and usable by pros and amateurs alike.  It\'s a great move into full-frame, because it offers the option of shooting DX, so as to be able to use existing lenses.  But when quality is bad, none of the rest matters.',' negetive'
'I own the nikon d700 for a year and half and was looking forward to upgrading my nikon bodies. I intended to get the d800 and the d600. I did many research into these bodies.

The next representative started grilling me on whether I knew how the screen worked, if I had broken it. To hell with Nikon. I hung up and order another from China for pennies.

'This could have been a fantastic camera had Nikon handles its customers\' complaints seriously. Instead they pretended there were no problems and that only a few isolated users had problems with oil spots. Now Nikon has further upset its customers by releasing the D610 further de-valuing the D600. I will never purchase another NIkon product unless they eventually recall the D600 and make it right.By the way if you have a D600 and never saw any oil spots take your camera off the automatic setting and shoot a landscape with clouds at f22. You will see the oil spots right away.',' negetive'
'Had my D600 for a couple months and didn\'t notice too much of a problem.  We were into over 5000 photos when dust spots suddenly went from mild to severe over the period of about 4 hours ..... during a product photo shoot.  I was so embarrassed for my equipment and I didn\'t have a clue what to tell the manufacturer, who finally left and asked to reschedule once the equipment was repaired.  I was embarrassed to say the least.Anyway, I just received my camera back from Nikon.  They still won\'t say what is going on or if it was really \"fixed\" or just cleaned.  Time will tell, I guess, but I am so discouraged because I don\'t know if this will continue or not. Of note, I had a D200 for 5 years and never needed the sensor cleaned once, and the D600 needed cleaning in the first 3-4 months.  To make matters worse, Nikon took almost 4 weeks to return the camera, that sucks.  They have a web site where you can find updates, but it\'s all but worthless: they use cryptic codes to say what is going on, and they may or may not update the site, so it really doesn\'t reflect what is going on.  For instance, the site said it was done for 6 days, and when I called them, they said, \"well sometimes when it says \"bill\" for a long period of time, it\'s actually been shipped.\"  So even their own techs know that the web site info means nothing.Something is clearly wrong here and from the reviews, I don\'t think it\'s a small percentage at all.  One rental place said all 20 of their cameras were effected.  20/20 with the same issue?  Mnnn.I hope this isn\'t a life long issue with this camera.  It was cleaned under warranty although I am not sure why ... if it were something I did, they wouldn\'t cover it under warranty would they?I wouldn\'t have bought the camera if I knew about this issue.  I would have waited, it\'s just not worth the embarrassment and unknown future.  I surely can\'t send this camera in for 4 weeks several times a year ...not to mention that after the warranty is gone, I will have to pay for it.I wouldn\'t recommend this camera at all right now.  Once Nikon says they have the problem fixed ...... then no problem.UPDATE:  So the review above was done in Early 2013.  Since then I sent the camera back in July 2013 and I was told they replaced the shutter.  Today, October 2013, I am sending the camera back for the third time for the same dirt/dust/oil spots.  After talking with Nikon support over and over again concerning the same problem, it\'s my opinion that there is little sympathy or understanding of what this is putting customers through.  Out of 12 months that I have owned the camera, it has been out of my hands for more than two months.  That\'s not the bad part.  The bad part is they apparently don\'t know how to repair this problem and I am stuck with a dud.  The attitude that I get from Nikon is, \"well, that\'s just your bad luck.\"  They also \"have no information about the problem.\"  It\'s just surreal dealing with these people.  It would seem no one knows anything and no one has the \"authorization\" to do anything to make the situation right.  The support is nice enough, just none of them know or can do anything.  I have never had an experience quite like this with a technology company.  Anyway, at this point, I don\'t want the camera anymore.  It\'s not reliable and they apparently don\'t know how to repair the problem yet.  This is just not worth the hassle, for me.  I hope this helps someone else.',' negetive'

'I was eagerly awaiting this impressive camera since first pictures started showing up on rumors web sites. I\'m not a photographer, just an enthusiast but the time came to upgrade my Pentax iST-dx and I wanted to get something of a high quality which will produce photo and video assets you can be proud of for years to come. So after consulting with my family ($2600 is a big deal for our budget), reading a bunch of favorable reviews (including Amazon\'s dpreview.com) I decided to buy into Nikon platform and D600 in particular. Soon after expiration of the 30 days Amazon return policy, the infamous dust issue started happening. Since Amazon would now charge a prohibitive restocking percentage I decided to wait until \"the dust settles\" and sell it on eBay with a small discount. To my surprise Nikon dropped price for the same kit I bought they ask $700 less and that is just 3 month after the product launch. I think they decided it will be cheaper to do this instead of recalling the camera. My value in this camera vanishing quicker than real estate equity after the housing bubble. Why bother admitting the guilt if you can just burn early adopters and drop 25\% (huge margin allows them) so people will be impulsively buying their defective product without reading reviews. I\'m calling to launch a class action against Nikon, it seem this is the only language their corporate management listens to. And one more thing. Did anyone noticed that after being acquired by Amazon, dpreview.com is now playing along with manufacturers? They sure get more access to the exclusive per-releases but it seems that credibility plummeted.',' negetive'
'This is a long post. The quick synopsis is as follows: The D600 HAS an issue with dust and oil. They have admitted to an issue finally in Feb. Their cust service is the worst I have experienced. After 6 months we got a full credit from the vendor and purchased a Canon 6D. We are thrilled with the Canon. The technical features are not the D600 but the Canon has not come with the free oil and dust spots that the D600 came with. For more details please feel free to read the entire post. BUYER BEWARE.I bought my wife a D600 in November at this great price of $2,395 from a different vendor (Amazon did not have the same price.) With the holidays we were not able to do too much with it but by February we noticed the issue of dust\\oil\\noise on many of her pictures. My wife was a professional photographer and as we get closer to retirement we are thinking of a small cottage photo business or just enjoying a passionate hobby. This should have been a great experience.We went to the Addison Texas Nikon photo school on Feb 23 and 24th. We decided to wait until after the class to send it in as we followed Nikon\'s protocol. They reviewed the pictures we sent in and they said send it to them in California. On the 25th we sent it in which cost us $137 ($122 for shipping and insurance and another $15 for the box and packing materials.) We sent it in two day UPS. They did not even acknowledge receipt of the camera until the next week even thought we had proof of delivery. Once they looked at it they simply cleaned the sensor and sent it back.Right out of the box, we barely had the camera body open for 10 seconds while we attached a lens, we experienced the same problem. We called them and went through the hassle of sending in the pictures. By the way we received different instructions each time for the proper way to send files and each time it took several tries. They really should know how to handle large files and be consistent. We implied once again that we did not want to have to pay another $137 to send it back. We received the same email saying sorry but you will need to send us the camera again. We had enough. We were never offered a prepaid UPS label.We went to a great local distributor. We did not buy this from them but since we have shopped there before they were gracious enough to listen to our situation and send it in to the Melville operation on our behalf. Just like you our camera was put on parts hold. They eventually, after 4 weeks and me getting on the phone with them, replaced the shutter mechanism and did a complete low pass filter cleaning. They sent it back apologizing for the issues and even sent me a check to repay me for my original shipping. They explained I should have been offered a free shipping label. There were several other miscommunications that are irrelevant as they had nothing to do with the issue at hand.The camera arrived at the distributor on Thursday and we picked it up on Friday. We shot some pics on Saturday and went to the Dallas zoo on Sunday to put it through some real shooting. We got home Sunday evening and we saw the issue reappear. We started shooting at around 11:30 AM at 1:05 PM we noticed the first issue. We figured this out as we reviewed the shots Sunday evening using Nikon\'s software. The spots gradually got worse. Yes we do have the pics to back all of this up which we eventually got to send to Nikon on Monday.Monday afternoon they issues an overnight UPS label. I boxed the camera up and sent it back to them. They had a manager intercept put on the label to review. My wife will be travelling internationally next week and we needed the camera (we requested a replacement) before she left. I heard nothing on Tuesday morning but followed up and found out that they had it. I was told I would hear back later that day or early today.  Nothing again. I call up and am told they will speak with the service manager and put in a request for a replacement camera. I would hear within 24 hours. In less than 6 hours they called me and said that the service manager said there is only one spot and they are simply going to clean it and send it back.Now the pictures clearly show more than one spot and additional noise or again more spots. I asked them to review that as I do not believe they reviewed the pictures although why would they agree to overnight something for pickup after they saw the pictures if there was only one spot?So in less than a week I received a refurbished camera with a new shutter mechanism and a cleaned low pass filter. In less than 4 days they requested the camera back. This is the third time it is in for the same issue. They did not offer to replace the camera. They are simply going to send it back after a sensor clean.Here is the dilemma: The original place I purchased the camera from has graciously agreed to take it back and put me into another camera. They said we could either get another D600, a different camera or a store credit. That is customer service. That is a great customer experience. Nikon should learn a lesson from this. Right now I am leaning towards getting rid of our Nikon Gear. You see we also bought a D3200 and a Nikon 105MM micro lens as well as some other smaller items. That may  sound drastic but that is how they have made us feel. We would rather have a nice working model of the D600 but how do I in good conscience reward them with more business after how we were treated and how the other people with poorly working D600 were treated. While I have no idea how prevalent the issue is, the manner in which they have handled it is disgusting. I am happy for all the people who I know and hear about that have working D600. However, a $2000 plus investment for a consumer or a pro is a significant amount of money. With Nikon currently reporting more than a $159M profit this quarter (down almost 50\% on a 5\% increase in sales), why should their customers take this kid of treatment?For everyone with a good working D600 enjoy. For everyone who has been treated poorly by Nikon customer service I empathize with you. Luckily there are still some great companies that treat their customers with exceptional respect. Nikon could learn a thing or two. They have brought fumeiyo upon themselves.',' negetive'
'The camera has two problems. First, dust and/or oil accumulates on thee sensor and needs constant attention. This is especially a problem at higher f-stops. Just dial up to f16 or higher and you\'ll notice hundreds of dots. And it doesn\'t stop after a few thousand activations, as some have indicated. It is also a problem on all the d600s, not just the first ones. If that weren\'t bad enough, Nikon still pretends that this isn\'t a problem, even though they\'ve introduced a replacement camera, the 610. Worse, they imply that it is a user problem. I would avoid the 600 and not trust Nikon on anything. They\'ve lost all credibility. The 600 is largely unusable unless you want to risk damaging the sensor, which might be okay because the camera is basically a $2000 paperweight.',' negetive'
'The dust issue continues to reoccur OVER and OVER. Local camera shop will clean sensor for $90. EACH TIME this happens I need to fork over $90??? And it happens frequently. Every 1000 shots or so. I won\'t rehash what others have said about Nikon and the D610 but this is so disappointing after spending $2K on this body.',' negetive'
'The dust and oil splatter showed up on the sensor just past the 1,000 activation mark.  Since I bought this as a backup camera I did not notice the problem until long after my warranty ran out. I purchased a sensor cleaning kit and have now wet cleaned the sensor at least 15 times not to mention almost daily blowouts of the sensor box with a Rocket Blaster to clear dust.  Now with more than 17 thousand activations, it appears the oil and dust issue may be behind me. Would I buy this camera again? NO. Would I recommend it? NO. I think Nikon handled this problem with the D600 very badly. I might consider the D610 but not until the refurbished models come out later this year.',' negetive'
'I received it a month ago. It came with three big pieces dusts on the sensor. Did a air blow clean, then after 20+ picture taken, more dusts showing up. I cleaned it again, after 200+ pictures taken, more than 50 spots of dust/oil showed up on the sensor again. And Nikon does not have any acknowledgement on this known issue to many customers. It is totally unacceptable. D600 is becoming a self-contamination machine!',' negetive'
'I\'m writing this review at the point where I\'m returning the 2nd body I had back to Amazon. There are two parts to understand, the camera itself, and the issue plaguing majority of these bodies. The first body I had was bought in September 2012, and after buying, I immediately went on an international trip, which was going to be several months, since the body had just come out, and as I was traveling I had not heard about the sensor dust issue. I was shooting away and it was all good. At one point in time I was attending, the Formula 1 Indian Grand Prix 2012 (I\'ll be attaching a couple pictures), and I had tickets for all three days, being with a new camera I wanted to test it out and see how the system worked with Sports, given the camera has an unusually small AF area, if you compare it with a D7000, even the D7000\'s coverage is better, but I usually use the center focus point, and I dont mind that too much, but thats just me, some people use all focus points and for them, this is not exactly the best focusing system, in fact this is in my opinion is the biggest downside of the camera technically, which could be a deal breaker for some people.Anyway coming back to the grand prix, so for those 3 days, I used the camera on Continuous high speed, which was using burst of 10 pictures or so, throughout. I got a satisfactory enough keepers, which kind of also proved for me that the camera can do pretty decent in situations such as one I went though. However once I went home and started looking at the raw pics is when I realized the horror, at that point I had clicked about 4k Shutter actuation\'s, about 3k in the 3 days of grand prix shooting. And almost every picture was bloated with dust and oil, the final pictures I decided to process, were in hundreds, and I had to spend time for each and every one of them, the fact that cleaning out those dust spots is not necessarily easy when they are so many of them in each picture. This is when I googled and realized whats has been happening with the D600. I had a macro lens and I immediately took a picture stopped down, and I couldn\'t believe how dirty the sensor was. I immediately took it to a Nikon service center in New Delhi, India, I was charged about $15 and I got a clean sensor back in half an hour, I hoped that would be the end of it, but it was not the case, after a few hundred shots the sensor was getting dirtier again. And this is when I decided I couldn\'t keep this body. I immediate spoke to Amazon, and they were ready to take it back, once I was back in US. After coming back and reading about how the D600 sensor issue was probably non existent in newer bodies, I decided to order again around New years, but unfortunately I got another body plagued with the same issue, I have now decided that, I\'ll be returning the D600 for a D800, although it doesn\'t necessarily fulfill all my needs, and it might come with some AF issues, however Nikon CAN fix that, and I probably am going to get it fixed, but in the case of D600, Nikon has been completely mum, leaving a good majority of its owners in the dark of any development what so ever, this is very cruel to me, if I hadn\'t invested in an Nikon ecosystem of lenses and flashes, I\'d have walked away Nikon.Leaving the dust issues aside, the D600 is an awesome camera, Dynamic Range, ISO performance, resolving power, and ease of use. Keeping in mind this is not a professional grade body, the cameras controls are very nicely aligned, and having a D7000, it was great to jump onto the slightly bigger body with slightly better ergonomics. If the camera bodies I had used were not having any dust issues, or if Nikon would have owned up to this issue and perhaps suggestion a future fix, I\'d had given the camera a 5 star rating, but with my experience so far, its going to remain 1.',' negetive'
'Even with the negative reviews here about the spotting issues I was willing to take a chance on getting a D600 that didn\'t have this problem, but it was not to be. within just a few shots I was able to see the dreaded spots  when I viewed the picture files my monitor. I completely cleaned the sensor only to have the lubricant spots come back within about 30-35 shots. There was also an usualy amount of dust collecting on the sensor as well. If it wasn\'t for this problem the Nikon D600 would have been an awesome camera. I found the camera a joy to use and shoot with the controls all laid out in a logical (to me that is) manner. The live view worked espically well having the camera mounted on  a  tripod (ReallyRightStuiff TQC-14 and BH-30 ballhead).I can\'t think of anything I would change on the camera. Yes, I know many have moaned the lack of Exposure control in Movie mode, but I never got around to using movie mode myself. Sadly Nikon has really dropped the ball on QAULITY CONTROL  in producing the D600 and I see the problem exist in the D800 line as well. If not for the spotting problems I would have given the D600 a 5 star rating. Amazon, you should use your collective purchasing power and come down hard on Nikon for this mess, as it is costing you tons of lost revenue and many unhappy customers.',' negetive'
'...same dust and oil issues.  Purchased serial #3004XXX. Within the first 20 shots noticed spots developing on sensor (upper left in view finder)and had dust inside prism area.  I removed many dust particles from the sensor with a \"rocket blower\" but the oil spots required a wet cleaning.  After cleaning, the spots started to reappear within 5 clicks so I returned the camera for a different unit.  Serial #3035XXX.  The sensor was clean out of the box with only 4 shutter activations on the counter but dust and oil starting to appear at 35 clicks.  This body also has dust inside the prism box.  A rocket blower removed the dust but the oil spots remained.  I also noticed a small area on the mirror mechanism where the paint was starting to flake off, which I suspect is the source of the \"dust\".  These problems show up at f8 and are not user caused and make the camera unusable for landscape and video.  I returned it and the pro level lenses I purchased.  I\'m evauluating other options and would wait on purchasing this camera until Nikon solves these issues.',' negetive'
'I was worried about all the negative reviews regarding the dust/oil spot on the sensor problem. I put 2000 shots through it. So far, I only see 3 dust spots, not a problem.  The serial no is 3011XXX.  The D600 is a great improvement, coming from the D700 and D300. I\'ll update if there is a dust issue with this D600.Update:This is the best DSLR I have used. The oil/dust flaw is real. 500 more shots and the oil/dust spots got worse. 12 appeared on the high left. I\'ll try more shots to see if it\'ll stabilize. Nikon needs to address this issue. I have over 30 Nikon lenses so going to Canon is out of the question. With the D800 and the D600 having problems, sad days for Nikon users.Update:12/22/2012The function and image quality are the best I have seen. 300 more shots, and the dust/oil spots didn\'t get worse but are there if you look for it. The bottom line is how much can you accept. Nikon must come up with a resolution for the problems with both the D600 and D800. I will return this camera for an exchange, hoping that I\'ll get luck next time. For those of you who are still waiting, don\'t buy it until Nikon has a fix for it. After 25 years of using Nikon, I\'m slowly losing faith.Update:12/27/2012Tested 2 additional D600 (not from Amazon) over the holiday. Same conclusion, dust/oil spots when you get to 1500 to 2000 shots. One of the D600 has SN 500XXXX. Nikon has no solution for this problem, even with the newer production. If the spots is a problem you can\'t accept, return them. Amazon is good with the return/refund policy.Update:12/30/20122 more D600 bodies(not from Amazon), SN 50XXXXX, same dust/oil spots, one at 1200 shots, the other at 1500 shots. I won\'t touch another D600 until I see this problem is fixed by Nikon.',' negetive'
'I purchased this camera to travel to South America. I had used a D7000 for a year and I have 4 other Nikon SLR bodies.  Two days into the trip spots started showing up. These are not dust spots since you can see them when the mirror is locked up and they appear as small smudges on the sensor. I finally did a wet cleaning of the sensor with swabs designed for that and most of them came off.  They seem to be back now. What a disappointment from Nikon. Don\'t buy this camera until this problem has been fixed. If I did not have so much Nikon glass I would be looking at Canon full frame cameras.',' negetive'
'I purchased the D600 body about a month ago. I had used all my savings that I have been saving for about 2 years. I was very excited to buy a full frame camera after having used D3000 for about 5 years of my life. In the beginning, when I used the camera with Tamron lenses to take event pictures it did its job. The quality was superb and the colors as well as the focusing capability were excellent. All pictures were done in aperture of f 3.5~6However, recently I went to New Hampshire with the camera to hike the Lafayette Mountain. This time my main focus was to take excellent landscape pictures. In aperture of f11 to f 22, the pictures I thought they were perfectly focused and framed were filled with complete flaws when I checked with photoshop and lightroom. I saw numerous dust spots on the left corner of each pictures, and the focus was all over the place. Given the fact that there were lots of fogs and clouds as I reached the peak, I understood that sometimes it was hard for camera to decide what objects to focus. However, I was really shocked to see consistent dark spots at the same location of each pictures.It has been over a year since dust/oil problem has been numerously addressed by thousands of customers and yet Nikon did not fix this problem.This shows that they do not give a s***t about the customer\'s concerns as well as their reputation.I am planning on returning D600, Tamron 24-70 3.5, and Nikor 85mm due to this issue. I will never go back to Nikon again.',' negetive'
'I was very excited to buy this camera last year when it got released. I haven\'t used this camera much over the last year. First few times i did not realize but on my most recent trip when i took my camera, i noticed a flaw in the camera where the ISO and aperture keeps changing automatically! I set my ISO and aperture to some value, but when i click multiple photos, i get some photos that are underexposed and some that are overexposed.I don\'t know how i should fix this problem... :( I moved from Canon to Nikon for D600 for its features. I feel sad to have moved at all...',' negetive'
'After 1000 clicks, the sensor start to show dust on the left corner and Nikon refuse to fix it. As D600 owner, I feel that there is a level of quality that rides on the Nikon name and we pay a premium for this. when the quality drops below, I expect Nikon to stand behind and fix the problem. So disappointed',' negetive'
'Amazing camera... can\'t believe they sell it with the sensor dirty!!!Iso performance is great.Good autofocus except for the autofocus points being only in the center... a pitty.Nikon doesn\'t cover the brand new dirt/cleaning in the guarantee, so they want to charge me more than 100 USD for cleaning the brand new sensor.Pic showing dust/oil spots: i.imgur.com/el01Vfx.jpg?1',' negetive'
'This camera has a fatal flaw that is affecting a large number of D600s.  Specifically, the camera mechanism that raises the mirror during exposure is flinging lubricant onto the sensor.  This is completely unacceptable -- for more about this go to: [...]Because of this, you get very distinct spotting on your images.  The website referenced about mentions that Lensrentals.com had to clean 100\% of their D600 bodies to fix the problem.For the record, I have three other pro-grade Nikon DSLRs, and 20+ Nikon lenses, and have shot only Nikon for 35 years.  I\'ve never seen anything like this on my other cameras.  My first 200 shots were fine, but the more I took the worse this problem became.  Sadly, I purchased the camera for the recent Formula One race in Austin, TX.  I took roughly 3,500 shots during the four days I was at the track.  I am infuriated that most of these shots will need extensive retouching to fix these flaws.If you already own one of these cameras it\'s easy to find the problem.  Shoot a picture of the sky or a light-colored wall.  Underexpose a stop or two to help you see the spots.  If you have the issue it will be very apparent.And IF you have the issue please return your camera immediately!  I don\'t have any issues with Nikon on a personal level, but they need to be pressured into fixing this problem -- and big companies don\'t spring into action unless financial circumstances warrant it.  If enough people return their D600s -- and if enough people complain and make this problem known -- Nikon will be forced to fix the design flaw.  Furthermore, they will be less likely to let another design with this flaw slip through into production.I hope this review keeps others from going through this same experience!',' negetive'
'I really want to love this camera but unfortunately for me, the oil/dust issues were real. I tried 3 cameras and all produced the same issue. I thought I had a winner with this last one as it was great out of the box but after approx. 700 shots the spots began to show. The feature set and price point are everything I am looking for, very sturdy body for a prosumer camera and would fit my needs perfectly. For me, I was ready to switch to Nikon, I just can\'t see spending $4k on camera body and a couple lens to be left with this issue. When I called Nikon to see what they can do, my only option was shipping to them at my expense as they do not acknowledge an issue! This is a 3 week old camera and that is flat unacceptable. I am convinced this is the camera I want, but will wait and let the dust settle, and see how Nikon handles the issue going forward. I am confident they will correct the issue, even if they don\'t admit to it. I usually don\'t write reviews but the issues were bad enough I felt I should. It is just something to consider for others looking at this as well. Do your homework on when the fixed units are out there. I am honestly surprised Amazon has not pulled this with all the other reviews on the same issue. I have seen them do similar things in the past with a receiver from Onkyo that myself and many others had issues with. Fortunately, Amazon is awesome to deal with and I never worry about them standing behind what they sell!',' negetive'

'Purchased a refurbished version thinking that not only that there would be cost savings but that perhaps a body that had been through the refurbish process would have had the dust problem checked and fixed if needed.

'First some background:I started getting serious with photography some years ago and bought the D60 after having only Sony Cybershot point and shoots. Needless to say, this was a major step up in image quality, but also required learning more about photographic science.After a couple years. the AF on the D60 started missing auto-focus more and more, and my choice was either get rid of it, or get it fixed for mucho Do-Re-Mi. It wasn\'t awful and most people wouldn\'t even notice, but i\'m a pixel peeper so it was unacceptable to me.I decided to get a new camera, and needed to stay with DX due to budget, and went with the D5100. This was a pretty good upgrade, but, to be perfectly honest I felt something was lacking. I was concerned that my image quality demands had outgrown the DX capabilities (I am a pixel-peeper).After a year or so, i came across some money, and decided to go for it - I got the D600 and man, this thing is a major step up from DX. The first few shots blew me away. The improvement in clarity of the FX sensor over DX is immediately noticeable. Now I find myself having to get rid of my DX glass and get FX instead, which is slightly painful, but definitely worth it.High-ISO performance on DX vs. FX is just night and day.Why 1 star? Well, the oil splatter problem, that\'s a no brainer. I got it cleaned at about 1000 shots and the oil spots have re-appeared.Nikon made very little effort to appease consumers.',' negetive'

'I\'ve just bought a D600. After reading the reviews it seems like there have been quite a few issues reported with sensor being dirty (dust or oil): either right out of the package or after shooting some photos. Probably what\'s happening is excessive oil from moving hinges inside the camera (shutter) deposits on the edges of the sensor and then attracts dust. While this shouldn\'t happen out of the box to a high end camera, and Nikon should make modifications during production to minimize the issue, don\'t dispair...For anyone owning a DSLR, I would suggest investing $50 in sensor cleaning swab/liquid/brush kit....Regardless of whether Nikon employees over-greased the damn levers or not, if you are a heavy use of any camera, learning to clean your sensor periodically will ensure crisp clean photos. It\'s very easy to do. Google \"DSLR sensor cleaning solutions\" and you will see videos of how it\'s done. Very, very, very simple...and you should be set to go....as for voiding the warranty, don\'t be scared...it\'s no different then cleaning your inner mirror or lens...If you put a scratch while cleaning either one of these, you will void the warranty as well...but if you do it carefully and follow basic instructions, you\'ll be fine....I periodically (every 3-4 months) clean the sensors on my cameras. A lot of times I\'ll visually check for dirt/dust just to make sure I am OK.... In the case of the D600, at worst case scenario, once the excess oils have moved out (usually happens the more you use the camera), you\'ll probably not have the issue of constant spotting....and then all you have to do is simply maintain a clean sensor...As for Nikon, they are better off finessing their production line to not over grease the shutters, and they will avoid a lot of insult and refurbishments... it\'s really sad to see their great technology get overshadowed by shoddy workmanship.',' negetive'
'Even though I really like the features and the image quality of my D600 there is one major issue that spoils the whole thing for me:After just 2 weeks of normal shooting without even changing lenses there gathered a lot of dust and even oil on the sensor. I got this cleaned by the retailer. After another 2 weeks the dust was there again and I found out that there are many others having the same issue. So I sent back my D600 until there\'s a solution - or otherwise I\'ll wait for Canon\'s 6D',' negetive'
'+1 on the dust spots on my recent purchase here. After one thousand photos, my d600\'s sensor was very dirty. The 24-70mm was the only lens mounted on this camera and was NEVER unmounted since photo number one. The photos were clean when I first received the camera. My biggest worry is the camera will generate dust spots in mid shoot. I\'m not talking about small specs, these are very noticeable dust spots on the photos at 2.8; I will recommend my fellow Amazon friends delay the purchase until this problem is resolved.',' negetive'
'i bought this as a gift for a cousin. The first one arrived broken and had to be returned. the second one arrived and a few days later you advertised this camera at a price $600 less than I paid. I was told that I could return it but would have to pay a restocking fee of 20 to 50 percent which would wipe out the lower price. I dont think this is a good public relations policy since the camera I received as a replacement of the broken one was received only a few days before the price drop.',' negetive'
'I was a first adopter and bought my d600 in September 2012.  I like to shoot long exposure which accentuates a dirty sensor  After a month I finally noticed spots/oil and sent the camera to Nikon for repair and in a week they returned the camera.  The spots--dust, oil, whatever were fainter but still there.  I sent the camera back a second time.  The second return from Nikon also had a dirty sensor.  I sent it back for the third time (each time with images demonstrating the dust/oil).  This time I was given a new camera.  I took the second camera out, shot the sky at f22, ran it through some manipulations and found a dirty sensor--out of the box.  I sent the camera back (now the fourth time).  This time Nikon listed a bunch of repairs with it\'s return.  I took the camera out of the box shot the sky at f22--dreaded dust and oil spots appeared.  I sent the camera back (now the fifth time) in March 2013 and I just received a check for the amount paid for the camera.  Now I am wanting a full frame sensor camera and simply don\'t trust Nikon.  Just wondering if problems with early iterations of this camera have been repaired in later ones.  People who don\'t shoot long exposure or at small apertures might not notice dust/oil.  Those who do, will.  BTW, Nikonusers.usa refused my review that pretty much said what I said above.  No rant.  Just facts.  I bought this camera from Amazon but discovered dust problems past return date.  I simply don\'t want to deal with Nikon again where reps appear to talk from talking points, saying you can\'t believe what you read on the internet.  Well I had two cameras with dust/oil issue that Nikon service couldn\'t clean or repair.  So much for internet as my evidence.',' negetive'

'I called Nikon several times concerning the oil spatter issue I\'ve been reading in Amazon and other review blogs to see if they corrected the issue.  I\'ve had to leave voice messages because no one seems to pick up their phones or the queues are way too long.  I wanted to purchase a new body as the features of this body sounded excellent except for the oil issue.  Most reviewers have said that they cannot get any feedback from Nikon and that the company has failed to address this issue publicly in any of the camera forums or on their website.I never got any responses back to my calls or my emails.  I see on their site that they just dropped the price of the body below 2K US now.  I guess there are still a lot of bodies on the selves with the issue and they don\'t want to recall them and fix them.  BUYERS BEWARE. If you get a body, chances are you\'ll have weeks or dealing with a really crappy customer service department to get your oil issues resolved.  I\'ll stick with my DX camera and lenses for now.  Been a Nikon user for over 40 years.  It\'s sad to see a quality company put out a defective camera and not conscientiously address it to their fans and users.  It\'s sort of like Toyota and their acceleration issues that they kept denying.My recommendation is don\'t throw your hard earned money into this camera body until Nikon adds up to the issue.',' negetive'
'Take the Nikon Professional D3x body that sells for $8,000.00 and put it into a more compact sized body with a few less features and less weight while improving the sensor and making it virtually noise free out to ISO 6400 ...then reduce the price by $6,000.00 while throwing in an execllent \"walk around lens\" called the Nikon 24-85mm and there you have it...the amazing Nikon D600!!!I am afraid I must edit my previously glowing review!The Nikon D-600 takes the most amazing pictures and the bundled deal with the 24-85mm lens was amazing especially as it is a new release.The sad sad news...after hitting 1010 pictures my sensor is absolutely loaded with oil/grease and what appear to be either specs of paint or metal shavings. Something is likely rubbing against something causing vibration that spews oil and then shavings where the two mismatched surfaces collide. It takes 1000+ photos to finally reveal a HUGE defect!!! I have only had the camera seven or so days and now this.In corresponding with a Nikon tech they informed me that they would pay shipping both ways for a cleaning but the camera would eventually have to be returned for a repair/fix when the entire scope of the issue finally comes to light. That means Nikon does not know exactly what is happening and therefore does not know what to replace or do. Hence they choose to place us consumers on the \"ignore list\" as sales of unsuspecting customers continue.No way am I sending in a $2000.00 camera twice when the company does not know what the deal is.... now and possibly later.Shame on Nikon...they should immediately halt production of the D-600 until they know what\'s wrong and can make a camera that is void of this HUGE defect!!! Have they no shame???????The sensor is the heart of a digital camera and loading it with oil/grease and possibly metal debris that might not be cleanable is only going to leade to having a camera that is never reliable.Shame on Nikon and Shame on Ken Rockwell for telling us to ignore the issue and just deal with it. The best approach is to stop buying the D-600 and return the ones that can be returned and then see how fast Nikon gets off their throne and fixes this issue!Halt production Nikon and focus your efforts on a fix!!',' negetive'
'DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA UNTIL NIKON FIXES DUST/OIL WIDE SPREAD PRODUCTION PROBLEMSI bought this camera a little over a week ago.I too have the infamous and common dust/oil problem. (seems to just be dust for me thankfully). Anyway, Nikon seems to refuse to acknoledge the problem and says it\'s basically normal.. I know i don\'t have to speak for others - but this is NOT normal to have to clean your sensor after a few photos.. every few photos..WILD LIFE YOU NEVER NOTICED WHILE SHOOTING CAN APPEAR NEAR THE TOP LEFT CORNER OF YOUR f8+ LANDSCAPE PHOTOGRAPHY. ;P ..In all seriousness though, this has been a huge headache. I didn\'t buy mine from Amazon, but i\'m posting here to discourage people from buying a product that was not propertly quality assured. I wasn\'t able to return mine so i\'m stuck with it until Nikon acknoledges this. It\'s not fun, and this is a wide spread issue.Otherwise the camera itself is fantastic. I put 1 star to emphasize my displeasure with the dust/oil issue.',' negetive'
'It probably the best Nikon Camera ever made.  But too bad the QA is not there.  I love this camera but cannot recommend at the moment until all the camera recalled for sensor and possibly vacuum the inside body.To test your camera if having issue like others on the Web.  Please have your aperture at 16 or smaller.  Set it in landscape mode and point at the sky and shoot.  And you too will see how filthy and dirty this camera sensor is.  It need to be cleaned and vacuum the dirt inside the camera body.  You can clean it by your self, but a few hundreds of click, the new dirt will popped up on the sensor.  I returned mine and wait for the new batch with QA before I buy again.',' negetive'
'I am a newspaper photographer and have had Nikon D200s, D300s, a D700 and (for my own personal use) a D800, and have been very happy with these cameras.  I take good care of them and have them cleaned regularly by Nikon Factory Service (In my opinion, don\'t go anywhere else for service).  However, the D600 I recently purchased has been a headache right out of the box, that is, noticeable and gradually accumulating dust and OIL SPOTS on the sensor, mostly on the left side of the image (or the right side of the sensor).  Nikon has finally (and Nikon rarely does this) acknowledged the problem, and they suggest attempting to clean the sensor according to instructions in the camera manual, and if that doesn\'t help, sending it in for factory service.  I suggest skipping trying to clean the sensor yourself.  Send it in to Nikon Factory Service.  I sent mine in two weeks ago and (interestingly) the repair is held up because parts need to be ordered and factory service is considering this a major repair.  It sure sounds like they were unable to get the grime of the sensor themselves without major parts replacement.  It is suggested the shutter is throwing lubricating oil, possibly caused by a gap on the side of the shutter mechanism.  I absolutely would not recommend buying this camera at this time.  Do a little research online, and thorougly check your camera.  You may have not noticed the problem because your images are obscuring the spots.  Do a careful test on a uniform surface, such as a wall.  It may help to pop up the contrast a bit on your editing program.  You\'ll discover a lot of buyers have been disappointed because of this problem.  I can\'t imagine anyone even considering purchasing this camera right now.  If Nikon can fix the problem, then they will have a wonderful product.  I am hoping factory service is installing a modified and improved shutter module as well as a new sensor.  Be sure to check your equipment while the camera is under warranty.',' negetive'
'Spot issue is definitely there and I have started noticing it within about 200 shots on \"upper left\" and \"left center\". They are two pretty big black spots not specks. Agreed I have been able to take care of it using LR... but should I have to use Lightroom, and remove  spots in every picture I click ?Why ? Did I get it for free.. and is that why I should stay quite ? No way.This is my 3rd Nikon body. I loved D90 but moved up to D7000 for better low light capability but D7000 to date has a focus issue that I hate to admit, and of course Nikon never owned up one bit.Now I paid 2K with the 24-85 lens deal and am shocked and surprised that spot/dust issue persists. I tried a lot to make up my mind to keep it.. but it\'s getting worse. One spot has turned into two..Is this sealing issue, oil issue.. I din\'t know . I just put on single lens and that has stayed in place.. how could these giant blobs be getting inside my camera? And of all the places on the sensor !!! #1 job of camera is to click pics and  if it can\'t click clean pics what can it do ?I will be returning mine and keeping D7000 and this hurts.Some additional thoughts given I am current D7000 user, and just sold my D90 in anticipation of me moving to full frame :1. D600 really really just feels like a D7000 in mos tregards (even IQ IMHO)2. Focus points are all stuck in the middle of the sensor even though the sensor is huge given full frame3. Have see better low light performance in D600 as compared to even D70004. More megapixels are good as you can crop much tighter after the fact.5. Overall my D600 is either overexposing or underexposing at the exact same settings with flash on when compared to D7000, could be a camera specific learning I need to work on, but did not see much IQ improvement I was looking forEdit:Greeko - I am now more and more convinced that:1. Problem is with all D600 units as mine was ordered on Dec 28th, received on Jan 2nd, it took only about 150 pics for nasty spots to show up2. I got suckered into the \"deal\" with the 24-85 lens, which is no longer available.. in part making it emotionally difficult for me to agree mentally to send the camera and lens (+128 GB Card + WU-1b wireless unit) all for 2K + tax.. But the good thing for you is that deal isn\'t available anymore so easy decision. That lens also BTW is only 3.5 - 4.5 much worse than the 17-50 2.8 Sigma that I keep on my D7000 all the time.3. I will be keeping my D7000 and 3 othe rlenses that I as about to put on e Bay - 17-50mm 2.8 Sigma, 50 1.4 Sigma and Tamron 90mm macro..4. I am clearly disappointed, and pretty shocked at Nikon trying to hide this under the rug.. come on Nikon, own this and we will buy this again and love you like we have for years.. otherwise I am not sure I will be able to keep my years of loyalty intact.5. Technology is advancing, and I really think D90 was the last good camera Nikon produced. Time has come for me to start looking, D7000 is barely acceptable with it\'s focusing flaws. I tried D600 and is being sent back now.When Nikon sold faulty focus D7000s and I said it\'s bad people told me \"it\'s higher level camera.. your technique must be wrong.. blah blah blah\" but in the case of D600 there is not a single person who I know owns this camera (3 of my friends/colleagues) who have not had the spots start showing up sooner than later, and we all know what is an acceptable speck of dirt vs really bad blotchy spots.. And given I keep my eye glasses shiny with the glass wipes all day, I can\'t stand this crapola.',' negetive'
'I have taken 3,000 actuations with the D600 and have been pleased with the quality of the images. From the beginning I noticed the dirty sensor issue but since I usually shoot with the aperture mid to wide open this has not been a major issue.A few days ago, I was taking pictures of my 4 year old son at an indoor event. I noticed my autofocus was not working. After playing around with my settings for about an hour and still not getting a picture in focus without manually adjusting the lens, I went to my local camera shop. In retrospect, I should have purchased the camera at my local shop because of the follow up service. The salesman at the camera store played with the camera for a few minutes and tried a couple of their lenses. He said the autofocus mechanism appeared to be broken and I would need to send the camera back to Amazon.I spoke with Amazon and they said I would need to contact Nikon directly because I purchased the product over 30 days ago (September 29). I called Nikon and they gave me the address for their returns center and the procedures for the return. They said it is my responsibility to pay for shipping. I said I thought they should pay since the autofocus should not have broke and the sensor should not be getting oil spots on it. Bottom line, the customer service has been poor. They told me several times (after playing the I need to check with my manager game) that they would send me a label for free shipping. It has never come - after repeated calls with their customer service department over two days. Nikon customer service is nice on the phone but NEVER follow through with what they say they will do.I told the Nikon customer service agent that I have bought two cameras and over $10,000 in Nikon equipment over the last 4 years, and, as a matter of principle, they should pick up the cost of shipping my camera for repair. They must have some type of internal program to wear down customers to minimize their costs. Here is what I learned:1. Be careful of being an early adopter of technology. I should have waited 6 months for thorough reviews of the camera.2. If buying new technology, buy the equipment at a local camera shop. They will give you better service as they have a strong incentive to please their local customers.3. Nikon does not do a good job with customer service. They are behind the times in this area and do not understand how to build a relationship with their customers.Well, I will be shipping my camera UPS this morning to the Nikon Repair Center and paying the shipping costs. Nikon you win. Your strategy was successful.',' negetive'
'The \"dust particle\" problem with the D600 sensor, which is actually a \"shutter lubricant splatter\" problem is completely beyond excuse. How did that slip by Quality Control. The build-up on the sensor gets worse over time, and makes the camera completely unusable. My recommendation is Do Not Buy This Camera until Nikon issues a recall and fixes the problem on existing cameras and on all new ones in production.',' negetive'
'I am disappointed Amazon will not return the item for its sensor defect. The 30 day return policy should not apply here since I did like the camera for the first month - and it was only until I found out after 30 days that there is a fundamental problem with the lens dust/oil. It would be like buying a car that drives well at certain hours of the day and then not being able to return it because you hadn\'t tested it at midnight when the wheels fall off.',' negetive'
'D600 Serial Number: 3069***I thought Nikon would have resolved the dust and oil problem by now. I had high hopes for this super light weight FX body. I purchased the D600 on March 1, 2013 and returned it on March 5.The Good: Very light weight FX body. I could not tell the difference in weight compared to my D7000.The Bad: Very large amounts of debris located on the left side of the frame within the fist 100 clicks.  I was only shooting at f/5.6. I blew the debris off the sensor with ease using a rocket blower. Smaller dust was noted between 200-300 clicks followed by another blow off the sensor. There was very little dust noted after 600 clicks at f/22. No dust was noted after 600 clicks at f/22 on a blue sky. I was feeling very lucky and happy. Then at around 850 clicks the much talked about oil residue began to appear in the top left corner along with small dust particles.The dust problems occur within the body. The only time I removed the 50 mm prime lens was when I blew the junk off the sensor. After the sensor was clean I would perform an f/22 blue sky test to make sure the sensor was spotless.',' negetive'
'I have had the D600 for 3 days now. I got it with the Nikkor 70-200m f/2.8G VR II and have taken just over 1000 shots so far, all in the beautiful snow of the NY finger lakes. I have owned several DSLR\'s and SLR\'s before, but this is my first full frame DSLR. The photos with this wonderful camera and this fantastic lens are magical. I am still really a brand new user of the D600 and will update my review when I really put it through its paces, but I just wanted to post this quick impression because I am so delighted. Also I have tested to see if I have oil on the sensor problem with the shots I have taken in the pure white snow covering most of the frame, at f/2.8, and I cannot find a single flaw of this nature. I am using Lightroom 4.3 to view and adjust my NEF images. Reports suggest this is an out of the box problem, so I will hopefully not have this problem. I did also get the kit lens and I have tried it and its OK. I will be replacing it with the Nikkor 24-70 f/2.8G shortly. I also have the Nikkor 50mm f/1.8G which is absolutely excellent and I look forward to using it with this full frame camera. I did also get the wireless adapter with the camera which works well enough and will be useful under some circumstances. Overall I am delighted with the D600 and although I was prepared to return it in favor of the D800 if it did have the oily sensor problem, it does not. I recommend this camera to anyone who wants a full frame DSLR. Do be prepared, as I was, to buy the fantastic FX glass that Nikon makes. I highly recommend taking advantage of the discount offered by Amazon in buying such lenses at the time of purchase of the camera. Also look out for the special offers like free SD card and backpack. I did not see this offer and did not add the free items to my cart, so missed out. Not a biggie since I have 95mb/s SD cards and an incredible case in the form of the ThinkTank Sling-o-matic/30. My review is to be continued and I look forward to testing out the video even though this is secondary for me.Update: 12/29/12OK, I took more shots at f/14 to f/22, again with the Nikkor 70-200mm f/2.8G VRII. With a white background I DO have dark spots in the same places on every shot. These are clearly caused by sensor contamination. Out of the box the camera cap has been off no more than 6 seconds for 2 lens changes. This is unacceptable for a brand new $2000 camera. I will be returning it to Amazon as a defective unit and will change to the D800.Update: 12/31/12I just want to close off this review by saying that Amazon have been very good regarding the return of this camera. Of course they are paying for return shipping on the camera, but they are also paying for the return shipping of accessories I bought for the camera, supplied by other companies. They are not required to do this but have agreed to do so without hesitation. I have already ordered the D800 and it arrives on Jan 2nd. This camera had better not have any left-wide focus issues or I will drop Nikon and sell all of my lenses. Good luck to those who stick with the D600 and start cleaning the sensor of an out of the box camera. A great camera that will eventually be produced with the levels of quality expected.Update 1/13/13I received my D800 to replace this D600 10 days ago. All I can say is thank god the D600 was faulty. I would have never tried the D800 and for about $700 more it is superior is almost every aspect. Sure the memory cards cost more and it will eat up your disk space faster, but in every way that matters to me the D800 blows the D600 to pieces. I may well write an extensive review of the D800 but to be honest its all already been said. I love Nikon again and paired with the holy trinity lens set plus a few choice primes, the D800 is the best non-sports DSLR money can buy.',' negetive'
'Upgrading from D90 so the viewfinder is nice and big in comparison.  The noise performance at low light is good too.  Overall, what you\'d expect a full frame camera to be until you start using it and wondering why they decided to do certain things the way they do.More seriously, I have not found a way to change the aperturewhile in video mode even when not shooting.  This is a serious flaw.  The D800 does it and I don\'t think this should be something that\'s left out on purpose if they want a serious video camera.  I have to switch back to photography mode, pick the aperture, then switch back to video mode and start shooting.  If the conditions change while shooting, you\'re SOL.I was also annoyed at how the AF doesn\'t lock in when there is still plenty of light/contrast in the scene when using a flagship f/2.8 Nikkor lens.  If the subject is close, it\'s not a big deal because the AF assist light kicks in, but for things like concerts or weddings where you have to stay at a distance and it\'s low light, you\'re SOL again.Furthermore, the AF points are clustered in the center.  This is annoying but I could make it work, just leaves more wiggle room in the rule of thirds.As for the Oil issue, it\'s too early for me to check but this is a serious concern and I hope Nikon comes out and addresses it.  Man up Nikon.  Public Relations do matter.Less serious, why did they reverse the zoom in and zoom out buttons than previous generations?***update #1 after 2 days of owning*****I wanted to make sure my review of the focus system was fair so last night and tonight, on this holiest of weekends (Halloween), I took the camera out to a few bars and clubs.  This time I had an SB-800 flash on the camera which means that the camera uses the flash\'s Auto-Assist matrix light.  Again, the camera failed to lock in focus on any other point except for the center.  Again, I was using the Nikkor 24-70mm f/2.8 (a freaking $1900 pro lens).  I don\'t think I can really trust this camera too much in low light which is sad considering I got a full frame camera for low light.  The AF system is severely lacking in this camera.Another problem I found is the LCD screen is larger but very poor. I guess it\'s better that pictures in the back look worse than on the computer since in the past it was the other way around with my Nikons but I just can\'t trust this camera very much during these situations.***update #2***I had 3 very different shoots yesterday.  One was at a professional sports arena pretty close to the court.  Using the 85mm f/1.8, the AF was very good.  No issues at all.Shoot #2 was in day light shooting at ISO 100.  Again, everything was beautiful.Shoot #3, at a dark museum.  On some items (very large well lit) exhibits, it was fine, but as soon as there was anything with a reflection, the lens failed.  this was mostly with my 80-200mm f/2.8 AF-D lens.Another thought, RAW files are HUGE on this - damn near 30 MB...*****Update #3****Hold everything.  I found 10 oil spots on my sensor.  At first I thought it was 3, but it\'s all over the place mostly around the left and top.  What a piece of garbage.Update #4Nikon is not answering emails, phones, nor tweets. Nice.Update #5Nikon finally decided to answer their phone. Smuggy woman who answered the phone said there were no widespread problems with the D600 and told me not to believe my own eyes nor the eyes of many others.  She ignored all the links and sample pictures I sent and refused to send a shipping label.  All she offered was to send me to a link to send the camera in but then I\'d have to pay for shipping.  6 pounds, across the country, fully insured is about $60.  I\'m sending it to BH now to see if the replacement will work.Update #6, BH (which has GREAT customer service by the way in case amazon doesn\'t work out for you for various reasons *cough* sales tax) Sent me the replacement and that too had dust.Before sending it back to Nikon, I gave the replacement a dusting with the blower rocket and also canned air and it looked as if it blew most of the dust away.  This time at least it was only dust.**Final update**It is now 4-19-2013 and I have owned this camera since October of 2012.  So all in all, it\'s been 6 months.Throughout this time I\'ve had to clean the sensor 3 times.  1st time I did it myself, 2nd time I sent it in, and last time I just blew compressed air and it got everything.  That\'s just a fact of life with this camera.  I wish it wasn\'t, but it is and it seems like the dust issue becomes a minor thing after the initial cleanings.  I am also not happy that you can\'t change the aperture in live view mode.For the photographs however, this camera is superb.  Often in the past I would have to use fill flash in many situations just to try to balance light out but with this camera, the dynamic range is so high that I get away with lifting the shadows later.  The ISO performance is also insane.  I don\'t give using ISO 6400 a second thought.Final (really final) updateIt is now November 2013. The dust is still here and gotten worse.  It never goes away, it\'s like sensor herpes.  Nikon still hasn\'t admitted problems but they fixed the problems that don\'t exist by rolling out with the D610.  Thanks for nothing, Nikon.',' negetive'
'Returned my one today.  It was a good camera until taking around 200 shots.  I love its D7000 style 39 focus points; I love nikon low light sensor performance; I love the light weight and awesome size; but I have no choice to say goodbye to D600 due to dust, dust, and dust on the sensor.  It\'s not easy to stand on a $2000 camera with on going increasing internal dust.  Yes, report saying dust will reduce after takin more than 3000 shots, but I cannot see the reason to suffer 3000 shots for the dust reducing.

'This is without reservation, the WORST camera that I have ever purchased! I previously owned 2 Kodak \"point and shoot\" digital cameras and loved them both. This one, however, is impossible to use. The pictures are great, but trying to download them to your computer is a nightmare! Using either the card or internal memory, I couldn\'t get my pics downloaded to at least 2 different editing programs that I commonly use. I called \"Customer Support\" and spent ALMOST AN ENTIRE DAY \"chatting\" with them and yet, they couldn\'t solve my problem. Obviously, this was NOT operator error! They were patient, but MY patience ran out the longer the \"chat\" went on. Late in the afternoon, I was exhausted and asked that an agent call me in the morning. They said that they COULD NOT make outbound calls, even considering the lengthy discussion that we already had!!!! Speaking of the memory card, when you attempt to get it out of the camera, the batteries fall out and by the way, the camera eats batteries, BIG time. The on/off switch is difficult to use (it\'s sort of recessed) and you can only date your pic AFTER you\'ve taken it! There is NO user manual.

'I purchased two EasyShare cameras for my daughters last Christmas....they looked to be affordable, decent first cameras.  I had no idea that I was simply throwing money away.  Battery life is so poor it\'s like Kodak has played a joke on the consumer.....and the batteries are NOT rechargeable.  Not at all sure what the purpose of the cable is...it doesn\'t charge the camera, and it\'s not necessary to transfer the pictures.  My daughter received this latest model as a gift....and it is just as much of a piece of junk as the earlier model.  The construction is so poor (even the buttons) that I have to keep reminding myself that it\'s not a toy.  Completely shocked that Kodak would produce such a piece of junk and even more disappointed that they are allowed to sell it---or rather, steal money from consumers.DYB',' negetive'

'Kodak EasyShare c195 has more pixels and a little bit nicer looks than my old c663. I accidentally dropped c663 a few times, but nothing breaked off the camera, and the electronic components were last for 6 years. I was happy for that. For c195, I thought it must be better because it is newer version. Unfortunately, it was last for 3 months. The door that cover battery was loosen, popping out while shooting. I was going to return but no luck. The last time I was taking a picture then the battery door opened again, and that cause the camera slipped off my hand dropped to the ground. Two pieces of the camera frames, the top covered and the tiny function bottons came off. They looked alike pieces of  cheap toys that connecting to each others by the tiny latches on the edges. I managed them back in place. The three little buttons, flash, mode, and power are working but the shutter button is not working. Now, I can not return it because I do not have an insurance and no idea how to get it repair. It is better if they make the frame of c195 like c663. My first kodak camera was black and white, 50 year ago. It is the time to say good-bye to kodak camera. I just want to tell you who want to buy the Kodak EasyShare C195, must think over and over before you get less than you pay.',' negetive'

'I compared this to the Olympus camera that was a similar price. Due to this camera\'s slightly lower price and good reviews, I bought it. It is going into the trash as soon as I get my new Olympus. This camera has trouble focusing. Most photos I take are blurry, even after allowing it time to bring the focusing box on screen. You can\'t just shoot a picture, you have to coax it out of the camera. Taking many photos with the flash is a slow process. The camera misfires frequently so you end up with lots of black photos. When the flash does work, it only barely lights a room. On 90\% of my interior shots I have to lighten the photos in a computer software program. There is no way I have found to adjust the Fstop as there is in the Olympus so you are at the mercy of it\'s auto adjust to everything and it\'s not too picky about getting things lit or focused. The viewfinder has an adjustment so you can lighten what you see there, but then you aren\'t getting what you see on the viewfinder! The viewfinder may show a light photo but after you download it you realize it\'s very dark. What good is that?I use this to photo houses I work on and it\'s a pain.

'I have a part time job as a lister to earn some extra cash which requires me to take numerous photographs with a digital camera. One of the camera\'s is the Easyshare C195. I have an old 1megapixel A10 Canon that not only takes better pictures than the C195, it\'s far less frustrating.  My biggest complaint with the C195 is the fact that the camera never seems to focus on the object you are shooting, but the wall or a random space. The pictures at times look clear on the screen, but once downloaded are very blurry. I have never seen a camera take so many out of focus pictures. I had to take a picture of a Coach bag from every angle. I took 47 pictures of the front of the bag in our staging area. Not a single one of them was in focus. The camera also likes to apply some yellow filter at times to ruin pictures. I\'ve also noticed that if battery life is less than 50\%, the camera will not download pictures to the pc but rather an error will display.',' negetive'

'I guess you do get what you pay for, but the $79 for this camera was overpriced. So many things wrong with it:1.  I ordered the blue, which was lovely in the product picture. When I opened the box, I swore: they sent me a black one instead. Wrong. Upon microscrutinizing it, it was dark, dark, DARK blue. Barely \'blue.\'2.  The function \'buttons\' are made for Lilliputians with tiny fingers. Very hard to depress with a normal-sized finger.3.  The package does not include an instructional guide, just a tiny foldout thing with very scant info in 4 different languages.4.  To view the guide you have to log on to an internet site. Shameful that a decent quick-guide couldn\'t be included to carry around.5. This camera is supposed to be able to be set for sepia and black & white photos. On the online guide it tells you which buttons to click, and the color setting is one function under a menu category called \'Capture.\' The guide has around 7 or 8 selections under Capture: the camera has three, and color is not one of them.6.  The transference from the camera to the PC is not as one-step as the Canon, and you have to click on several options to get to where you can upload.Kodak: uh uh - never again.',' negetive'
'What a nightmare!First impression... wow that is one heavy digital camera! It takes forever for picture to get stored to memory card once you snap your picture. My memory card has speed of 4, which is standard memory card speed and my other cameras store it in 1 second. Next thing that sucks is that you have to hold you hand still when you take pictures or they will come out blurry. If you use flashlight your pictures will most of the time come out blurry. Video quality sucks really bad, it\'s all grainy like ancient old tv picture quality with snow in it. The sound in the video is really bad as well. Can\'t even compare with my 10 year old digital camera by sony. I tried to connect it to computer to upload pictures but it would never turn on. It was always like this since I purchased it. I had to put in memory card in my other camera to be able to upload pictures on pc. If you want headache and problems in your life.. this is the camera for you!',' negetive'

'This would not be a bad camera if you just want to take pictures of the family around the house.  For anything much beyond that, its not very good. It may actually be one of Kodak\'s worse. The buttons are tiny, in a crevice and not easy to use unless you can look at the camera in the light. You will never be able to turn the camera on quickly for a spontaneous photo. Not really all that big of a deal since it won\'t capture a quick picture anyway. The delay from the time you press the button to take the picture and the camera records it is so long that many subjects will not even be in the picture. Tried to take pics of the Air Force Thunderbirds, the only way possible is to \'snap\' the picture before the planes are even within the camera\'s viewfinder.  Then many times, it will blur a picture anyway. Turning the flash on and off, too difficult. Cannot turn flash on by the push of a button (it will only go to auto) you have to go to the programs. The program menu takes a while to navigate so you may lose a picture while trying to find a workable setting. And if the camera goes into auto shut off, you have to go through the whole programing thing again because it will come back on in auto only. All in all, the worse I have ever had and I have always been a huge Kodak fan. Don\'t have any idea what they were thinking of but this is a huge disappointment. Again, for a planned family event or some thing similar, probably good enough. For capturing special unplanned moments, you will just be disappointed.',' negetive'

'I purchased this camera 12/17/10 and thought I was getting a great deal at $80.  Wanted to replace my 5 yr old Kodak Easyshare that didn\'t have an LCD display and was 4MP.  This camera at 14MP takes the same quality pictures, no difference.  Another issue is that the batteries were dead in 2 days, sent by Kodak with the camera, with very little use, less than 20 photos taken.  My older Kodak could use the same batteries for 3 wks!  Also, the controls are difficult to navigate without using a fingernail and low light situations take poor photos, there\'s some type of delay for the flash and then you loose your shot.  Another issue is that it states takes SDHC cards but these cards have to be formatted, unlike regular SD cards and if you take the SDHC card out you have to go to the trouble of reformatting again.  SDHC card was not recognized when I tried to upload photos, whereas any SD card that I used in the camera was no problem uploading.  Also, didn\'t like the fact that there\'s no viewfinder for outside photos, in addition to LCD screen and you have to date stamp each photo that you take instead of just setting the date once and the date appearing on all photos you take unless you remove that option.  Took the camera back to the store and will use my old camera for awhile longer.',' negetive'

'My Canon Powershot camera was $59. I needed a cheap camera fast and I got mine within two days. The charger plugged directly into the wall with a place for the battery to sit. So far so good. But unlike all other cameras I have bought, it did not even come with a starter memory card. When I took a picture, it told me \"Cannot Record.\"  And there was no USB cable to connect to my computer either. That\'s a new one for me too.I repeat there is no memory card and no USB cord, so you can neither take a picture nor view it.But it did say in the book that there was a \"*power cord,\"(asterisk included) written in smaller font on the starter page under Package Contents. But there was no such thing. Then under the first step, \"Charging the Battery, \" it tells you to, \"Plug the power cord into the charger, then plug the other end into a power outlet.\" I was able to charge my battery without this power cord. It was only by using a powerful light that I could see that on the back of my battery charger was the model number inscribed as CB-2LF, and I did not need this power charger. Such needless aggravation.I have a wee website in which I am Amazon affiliate and I was going to write a review. But it looks like that will have to wait until the add-ons I ordered today come in. So much for trusting Amazon to give me the full low-down. It should come with a huge caution sign for buyers, especially at this price. These things do add up. How can you make a price/feature comparison if you have to calculate so many variables? Furthermore, a camera at this price, might be  for a gift, and the gift recipient would be pretty bummed if they had to order additional items just to make the Canon Powershot A2500 work.The bigger problem will be when I get the memory card and the proper USB cord, what happens if I don\'t like the picture of the camera or how it functions? Will the aftermarket companies allow me to send back their products and get a refund that includes the shipping cost? It would have been so much more convenient for Canon to sell a complete package.I guess  learned my lesson. The product description on Amazon gave the features of the camera. But it did not list what came in the box. I should have read through each review and customer Q & A to glean what was still needed to make this camera fully operable.If this were a car it would be missing its steering wheel, and other car stuff, which I can\'t think of the analogies, because I am so frustrated.But there are three nice things I can tell you: The cherry red is easy to spot in a dark purse and it is very, very light weight. And one kind person on this site Ricky Lorda, answered my question about the USB from the ask customer section of this page, saying that it did come with a USB cord (although as I mentioned, mine did not), and that was very nice of him to give me his quick response.',' negetive'

This version does not come with a memory card or the cable needed to download images.So cheap of Canon!!! The camera does a great job of taking pictures. But that\'s all you get from this version.Our original purchase had lots of bells and whistles on the camera and all the required accessories.

'This is my second underwater camera (previous being a Lumix one), and this one barely works. It is plagued by software issues and poor manufacturing. The screen starting showing random white lines after only a few days of use (not even having been underwater yet!) and it just went downhill from there, breaking down completely after a few weeks. We initially thought this would be a good product as we have a DSLR from Nikon, but we ended up very disappointed. Nikon seems to have focused more on adding dozens of useless gadgets as opposed to make a solid, sturdy products that takes good pictures. All this to say, we will stay away from Nikon products from now on.',' negetive'

'I purchased this camera in November to take underwater pictures while snorkeling.  The memory card and battery were installed prior to leaving our condo, so it was definitely a dry, clean environment.  Took a few pictures from the sailboat and everything was fine.  Took pictures while snorkeling and everything seemed fine until we arrived back at the condo.  Tried to turn the camera on so I could show the others the pictures that were taken and the it would not turn on.  I installed my second battery, and still the cameral would not turn on.  On closer inspection, there appeared to be water behind the viewing screen (in each of the corners).  I opened all of the doors and put the entire camera, minus the memory card and battery in a bowl of rice to absorb and moisture, then tried the new battery again.  Still, the camera didn\'t work.  It never worked again.I am very disappointed that my camera didn\'t last even one day.

'The Nikon AW110 takes great outdoor pictures, however, when we tried to take  underwater pics while snorkeling during our trip to the Bahamas in September 2013, we were able to take only 3 pictures before the camera stopped working.  There was no water inside the case and  I even replaced the battery with a spare one but the camera still did not work.  I just sent the AW110 to Nikon in Toronto for repairs which did cost me money to return them the camera.  What is frustrating is that we purchased this camera solely for our trip and unfortunately, we could not use it.

'I purchased this in May and used it 5-6 times - mostly in the pool. I took it to the beach and it failed after second swim in the sea. Completely failed - see pictures on the camera page. I had Pentax Optio W80 underwater camera for about 3.5 years; took it diving quite a few times and used a lot before it failed this spring. I decided to go with Nikon because you supposed to be able to take it to 59 ft - but it failed at 5 ft!Amazon refused to do anything about it because it\'s more than 30 days from the date of purchase. So you can return the product on a whim the first 30 days and not a completely broken product afterwards.Nikon charges for shipping the camera back and then decides if it\'s their fault or mine that the camera fails.

'I received this camera as a Bday gift and was very excited and thankful. The camera had been already set up for me with an extra high speed memory stick and so I was ready to start taking some pics. They turned out terrible. Image stabilization was terrible,half of the pics were blurred. The flash did NOT kick in with a low light setting,and when it did finally kick in it over saturated the image. Ive read the other negative reviews on this camera relating to the underwater features being equally as terrible. Im not impressed at all. I am disappointed and discouraged,seems like these point and shoot cameras have all these great features for wifi and HD video and such yet they dont seem to be able to take very good pics,not user friendly,a myriad of menu settings that you have to tediously go through to get the quality you want for a given situation.

'After looking at the many waterproof / rugged camera options, I decided to go with Nikon.  I have multiple Nikon dSLRs and lenses and have been very happy with them.  I now wish that I had paid closer attention to the other negative reviews.In good sunlight, this camera takes decent pictures.  I have only used dSLRs for a few years, and the pictures are not as good, but I didn\'t expect them to be.  I was primarily interested in the rugged and waterproof features.I ordered the camera over a month in advance of a vacation that was to include snorkeling.  With some light use, the back screen of the camera was scratched and scuffed, but I didn\'t worry about that because it did not affect the use or picture quality.The major problem was that within 10 minutes of taking the camera into the ocean, and with the camera not getting more than a foot or two under water (this was before we even started snorkeling), the screen died and went completely black.  Even after letting the camera dry out, the screen will not turn on.For the money, this camera is at best a mediocre point-and-shoot.  The only real advantage (in theory) would be the ruggedness and waterproofing features, but they do not hold up in real world use.  I do not have any other experience with waterproof cameras, but none of the others available could do any worse than this Nikon did for me.',' negetive'

'The negative reviews about the Coolpix AW110 screen going blank happened to mine, but fortunately within the warranty-return period.  The positive reviews are also true, particulary the good picture quality.  So I just wanted to warn others that if you take this underwater, there\'s a high chance its screen will fail.

We took it in the water and diving but did not go anywhere near the 59 feet with it.  My children are too young to dive deeper than 35 feet.  I have contacted Amazon for a return and have also contacted Nikon.  Having to go through the repair/return process is a huge time waster.  But, most importantly, this camera stopped working half-way through our two week vacation so we were not able to take pictures for an entire week except on our iPhones!  Completely unacceptable.  This is the first waterproof camera that I have owned that got water damage.  All other brands I bought have held up beautifully (we have a Go-Pro as well).  I would NOT recommend this camera, especially since it was so expensive and will not last.  Don\'t risk your memories!',' negetive'

I do not dive, I only use the machine in pool and sea to ordinary photos, never surpassed that is 3 meters.I thought it was defective on my unit, which has made me extremely unhappy .However, when talking to a friend, I discovered that he has the same problem as me.I wish Nikon would take more care with the quality of their products.Although still find their unbeatable DSLR, now I\'m looking for a better camera waterproof for purchase.',' negetive'

'Q. How do you destroy this waterproof camera?A. Put it in the water.This camera has several shortcomings, but the most glaring is that the water seals are ineffective.  The lip of the inner seal is literally 1 grain of sand wide -- even with very careful use and cleaning, it is not reliable.  After owning it a year, I took it snorkeling in 2 feet of water, and noticed a stream of bubbles coming out of the battery hatch.  Camera destroyed.But there are other problems.  The overall images lack contrast, probably because of the folded optical path.  The auto white balance is confused by many situations.  It is not uncommon to see a great image in the liveview screen while composing a shot -- say kids against backlit foliage.  When you snap the picture, the picture that is displayed (and stored on the card) is totally washed out.  It then goes back to the beautiful live view.  Sometimes changing the composition slightly would cause the camera to get it right, sometimes or not.  Very frustrating.',' negetive'
'I cannot tell you how disappointed I am with the Nikon Coolpix AW110 camera!It was purchased to use exclusively while enjoying water sports.  I recently returned from a trip to the Virgin Islands, where the snorkeling is excellent, crystal clear visibility, glorious variety of undersea life....Imagine my disappointment when this crummy camera stopped working the minute it went in the ocean!  The screen went black and the on/off button stopped functioning.(Ironically, the camera slowly came back to life after I left 2 mini silica packs into the battery slot for over a week after I had returned home.)I won\'t ever immerse this camera in water again, as it is obviously defective and NOT waterproof.I didn\'t need another \'dry\' camera as I already have several. :(Nikon customer service wants me to ship & insure it ( at my cost) for an evaluation/ estimate for repair costs.

'What is the minimum basic requirement that you should expect from a consumer electronic product in this day and age? That it should turn on and work.Like many of you, I bought this Nikon for a watersports-filled vacation, opened the box, charged the battery overnight, put the camera and the manual in my carry-on bag so I had something to do on the long flight. While in-flight I pulled out the camera expecting to learn all its features.I then pressed the ON button. Here\'s what happened: after several seconds of a blank screen,  a flash of white screen appeared together with a single exclamation point, then immediately blank screen again. Huh? I tried it again and again with the same result. I tried it with and without different memory cards. I tried it after pulling the battery out and back in, and making sure the battery orientation was correct. I studied the manual but found no special startup instructions or description of the exclamation point screen in the troubleshooting section.At the hotel I recharged the battery to make sure that wasn\'t the problem, but the next day the camera behaved similarly.To explain my prior camera history and experience, previously I\'ve owned waterproof cameras by Olympus and Fuji but since gave them away to relatives. I also shoot with the Fuji X-100s, a Canon DSLR, and several Lumix micro four thirds cameras and lenses. For this waterproof camera, I should have chosen the Lumix or Olympus or even GoPro waterproof cameras, but I thought that this would be a good opportunity to try a Nikon interface.In this day and age a consumer electronic product from a major brand that flashes an error screen right out of the box? Disappointing poor quality. I\'m never buying Nikon again.',' negetive'
'I have owned mainy waterproof Point and Shoots over the years.  This was the absolute worse.(please note, the camera was only opened & then closed immediately to charge the battery or remove memory card.  As well, the seal was always checked for debris before closing)Dry- Travel to Nepal & between the lense elements it would fog up if used often or in video mode.  So many photos wasted as blurred due to moisture.After trip, the camera was then sent in for warranty, and a new camera delivered.Wet -  used it on surface of water fine, when splashed.  Snorkling on the surface, and no more than 10ft deep, the camera died within in 5 mins and never recovered.Never again a Nikon..',' negetive'

'Short of it: Failed in shallow water like so many other peoples AW110.We purchased this camera a few weeks before a trip to St John Virgin Islands that involved a lot of snorkeling. The camera controls and features are great. The pictures were good quality for a little point and shoot. The pictures before the trip in a pool came out wonderful. The only issue that we had with it was that 3 days into our trip it died. The screen went black which made the camera little more than useless. Many other people complain of the same issue with it so it seems to be a fairly common fault with this model. The deepest we went with it was probably 5 or 6 feet, most of the time was surface snorkeling. If you want a camera that can get splashed while you are boating this is probably a good idea. If you want something that can go into a couple feet of water stay away from this camera. It seems unimaginable that it could actually go to the 18 meters and still function when so many of them break a couple feet from the surface. In short we want to love this camera, we tried to love this camera, the features are great, except the one feature that we bought it for, to use in water. Nikon if you actually had this camera waterproofed it would be a killer, instead it scares me away from your brand. Feel free to keep my camera that I used for 3 days and just sent in for warranty until you solve this problem since it\'s pretty useless to me as it is now.Update: We received an estimate from Nikon of $148.84 to repair this camera. The paperwork said that it was not covered by warranty. When I call to get more information as to why they denied the warranty I just get a message that says all their staff is assisting other calls then their phone system hangs up.

I would prefer to award no stars (at least one is required), this camera takes beautiful pictures when it works, but this hardly vindicates the appalling reliability that is obvious from the reviews on this and other sites.  No one wants to spend over 200 for a couple of days photography.You really need to sort yourselves out Nikon, read the reviews and weep for the prestige that your company once had.',' negetive'

'I\'m writing this on a trip to Hawaii, where i\'m going to miss out on a week of water photos before i leave due to this camera failing on me.I have had issues of the lens and screen misting up and have taken care to store it in a pouch with silica packets.  I have been meticulous with SD card and battery insertion, and checking the seal and debris.Yesterday, while casually paddleboarding, it finally succumbed to whatever design flaw that causes it to leak.Now it is dead and will never turn back on. Very disappointing for a camera with a rated 59 foot depth!  I never took it more than 4 feet underwater.I wanted a camera i could keep in my boardshorts to avoid theft on the beach, this one couldn\'t handle that basic task.',' negetive'
'We purchased this camera for our trip to St. John.  What a mistake!  Display died after our first day of snorkeling and water may have gotten under screen.  Camera should be waterproof to dive up to 59 feet!  Amazon should pull this camera from their web site.  It is a piece of junk and huge disappointment when you pay good money to purchase something to capture your vacation memories and end up having to buy expensive, crappy, disposable cameras.  I would rate it no stars, if possible.',' negetive'

'I bought this camera because I was going to be doing a lot of swimming and active sports in Croatia and I wanted to capture the unique experiences.  The camera took really good photos the first couple of days, but as soon as I got in the water...and I mean only for a swim, no diving... the screen went black. This was day three of a 12 day trip.  I was unable to use the camera for the remainder of my trip.  Once I got home, I turned on the camera just to see what would happen...and sure enough, the screen was working again.  Perfect timing.  For a camera that advertises as a deep water use camera, it is definitely a lie!!!!!!!!!  If you are looking for a camera to use in the water, I would pass this one up. You will regret it.  Lucky enough, Amazon is so great that they let me return the camera without an issue.',' negetive'
'Got this camera this morning, obviously super excited to open it up and start using it. As I took it out of the box, I\'ve noticed brown rust marks on the inside of the lens cover; the marks were mostly in the corners and then two spots towards the middle. Once switched on you can actually see two blurred spots as you move the camera around and of course they are visible in every single photo taken. It looks like the camera was water tested, got some water in (went unnoticed) and eventually the leaked rusty water gathered on the inside of the lens cover. How does leakage/water damage like this make it past quality control?!If this camera already shows signs of water damage the moment you take it out of the packaging then I can only smell disaster.This camera is going straight back to Amazon for a refund.',' negetive'
'I purchased this camera because I heard it had the best image quality of the \"tough\" point and shoots. When you\'re standing completely still, shooting a stationary target in ideal lighting conditions, it produces decent photos.However, when it comes to real world use, most of your shots come out completely unusable. Blurred subjects, and horrible under/over exposure. I\'m being completely serious when I say that iPhone cameras outperform the aw110 in real world use. My 8 year old midrange Canon powershot A540 outperforms the brand new aw110 in every way.  Very disappointing.I\'m sending it back for a refund asap.

'After reading the reviews for both the AW100 and AW110 and reading up reviews and comparison articles on the Internet, I thought this would be the best bet and most reliable.  So I bought this camera and 2 days later took it to Hawaii thinking that I\'ll be set to take all the underwater photos I want.  I read the user manual and made sure there were no obstructions on the side compartment where the battery and memory card is located before heading out to go snorkeling.  Probably no more than 5-10mins in the water and the screen goes blank.  I can\'t seem to turn it back on.  I\'ve let it dried out since then and sure enough the camera won\'t turn back on.  Dead in the water...quite literally.  I\'ve put in a return request, so let\'s see if Amazon will reimburse me for this junk.  I will be shipping this back in the next few days.  Amazon\'s already informed me they\'re going to charge me a return fee.  I recommend not buy this to begin with, and if you\'re going to take the risk, buy it from Fry\'s instead. It\'s exactly the same price at Fry\'s, and if you return it, you\'ll at least be fully reimbursed and not have to pay a return fee.',' negetive'

'I bought this camera and used it 3 times over a 2 week period.  I bought this to use while kayaking in the ocean.  I\'m an avid DSLR user and a Nikon fan for many years.  The camera was only used in the surf zone and was never submerged further than a foot and for less than a minute.  The lens immediately fogged up.  I think it was condensation as the water was very cold and the air was very warm (January in So Cal has been very warm).  Never-less, the camera was not usable until it warmed up and the fog cleared.  I returned and am trying a different brand of camera.',' negetive'
'Seriously, if you\'re considering this for any underwater photography... STEER CLEAR!!!  As others have posted, this camera isn\'t waterproof.  Used snorkeling and it died on the third time used.  Followed all instructions to the letter, yet the lens fogged up and camera wouldn\'t turn on again.  Would give a Battery overheated message and shut down.  So, 3 days into a 16 day vacation, our camera was rendered useless.  Thankfully we had our phones for land shots, but missed a ton of great opportunities underwater.SAVE YOUR MONEY and look for something else.',' negetive'
'I had this camera out of the box for a day and now it\'s right back in it and getting sent back. I started out wondering what I had gotten when the buttons on the camera were \"sloppy.\" I ignored that and continued to take pictures and videos to get a feel for the camera and it\'s different features. Zooming was impossible. The lens simply would not focus. I kept getting a screen message saying, \"initializing lens. Cannot focus.\" Well...no kidding! On the video\'s anything I zoomed into turned out blurry. With stills the lens either did not focus at all and the pictures were blurred or if it did manage to have a clear moment, the pictures turned out very grainy. Overall I was not impressed with the quality of pictures this took at all.I bought this because it was waterproof and could be used to take underwater pictures. Little is said in the manual about how to do that, however.  There are some \"don\'ts,\" but no tips or hints or instructions that might help someone doing underwater shots for the first time. This camera was a huge disappointment. I had read reviews and researched other cameras with similar features and decided on this one. My mistake.',' negetive'
'Here is the straight scoop. I read a ton of reviews of this camera, the Canon, Pentax, Olympus waterproof cameras. The problem is the reviews dont really use the camera underwater. We went to Bora Bora (trip of a lifetime) with our 4 and 7 year old and the camera worked great on the beach - but as soon as we went in the water it leaked water. My kids are young - we were snorkeling - so about 6-12 inches from the surface. I also bought Nikons floaty leash (worked great) so the camera was never more that 12 - 18 inches deep and it leaked. When it dried out it came back to life and does work - but anytime it is- immersed it leaks. Ive had a few Nikon cameras over the years and not had any problems. So I returned it to Nikon when we got back. I have just logged on to the Nikon service center to see the status - and heres what I see :Problem: LIQUID DAMAGE CLEAN & CHECKTotal cost of repair: $137.50*So - as much as I like the form factor of the camera and the photos are decent (when not waterlogged), Im not going to be taking Nikon\'s repair center up on their offer. Im in the market for a really waterproof waterproof camera. With two kids under ten - I dont need much - just a few feet of water - swimming pools and ocean.So Im afraid the other reviews you see on Amazon about this camera not being waterproof are true and while DP camera and others do great reviews - the reviews here are from people who actually have used the camera underwater.I run a company. Im not sure how Nikon feels about selling a product that claims to be waterproof and then attempts to charge you for \'fixing it\' when it leaked in 1 foot of water.',' negetive'
'I have owned this camera for two months, and now I also have a broken camera. Unlike some of the other reviews, my camera has taken fine underwater pictures on several dive trips (going 30 feet or more deep), while playing in the pool, snorkeling in the ocean, etc.  As far as a general point and shoot camera, I have not been impressed (both my Canon and Panasonic were far better, more intuitive and more customizable when it came to manual modes).  But, we held onto it because we were getting some great \"in the water\" shots. Unfortunately, on our last trip, the display screen went black and has never returned. The camera seems to turn on - even seems to take pictures, but since there is no view finder and the display does not work...All in all, I wish I had read the reviews on Amazon before purchasing. Too bad. Sorry Nikon - you have lost a customer.',' negetive'
'Agonised over buying this for days after reading the mixed reviews - am travelling in Thailand and was in Bangkok heading south so wanted an underwater/rugged camera - was sucked in by the 18m waterproof and thought \'surely it can\'t be that bad and if I really take care of it I won\'t have the problems others mention\'...2 weeks of owning it and treating it like a new born the following have been observed1) Someone described the screen as a scratch magnet - could not put it better myself - lady in the shop put a \'free\' screen protector on - horrified when made it back to hotel and took it out and immediately noticed TWO scratches that look to have gone through the protector! I bought a case especially after purchasing and put it straight in there - How the **** did that happen?!! Right now the screen is scuffed pretty much all over and I don\'t know how it is happening so easily! I treat my iPhone (using now to write this) far worse and the screen still looks good as new - I\'ve also just noticed the writing on the front is all rubbing off! Sure I don\'t really care about the looks but surely this should not be happening on a \'rugged\' camera?2) I like to mess around with white balance - not impressed with the AWB and equally not impressed with the manual set white balance (which is kinda laborious to go and set each time too) much prefer my old canon IXUS3) I also like to mess about with long shutter times and kicked myself for forgetting to check if this camera can do it - it can\'t as far as I can work out... :( the longest is 4 seconds using the \'fireworks\' scene mode... (Which means you also cannot use manual white balance in a scene mode...)4) Pictures - they\'re OK and I am most definitely no pro photographer but my old Canon IXUS that this has replaced seems to take far superior looking photo\'s5) The action button (the button you use to take the photo!) is hard to press and try to keep the camera still at the same time in my opinion6) The BIGGEST one and the reason that has prompted me to add this review is that the lens has just misted up!!! It\'s hardly been in the water! I tested it on day one in a sink full of water (break it in gently...) and no apparent problems - meticulously dried it and noticed there are holes around the lens area that were holding water in there so really let it dry out properly - since then it\'s been in the shallows in the sea twice (literally just took it in with me when paddling about in the surf at the shore) - taken back to hotel room and dried meticulously each time before opening battery cover... I am on the beach now and was just taking some shots then about to head in for a swim/snorkel and noticed the lens misted up...I am majorly ****** at myself and feel like kicking my own butt from here back to Bangkok to return it but I bought it knowing full well \'no returns\' and that the warranty (Thailand only...) only covers \'faults\' not water related damage...!How Nikon can sell this I don\'t know... Perhaps they will admit a design/build fault and some kind of recall?I will have a stab at trying to get my money back one way or another and attempt to contact Nikon directly (this is NOT a cheap camera!) but I think I have about as little chance of that happening as this camera surviving any more water related activities...Why people are giving it 5 stars and saying they have not even tried it in the water is beyond me - surely there are a billion and one cameras on the market that take just as good photos for a quarter of the price that work \'out of the water\' - the uniqueness of the AW 110 is that it is supposed to be ruggedised no...? I mean that is what you\'re paying the money for right...?Really really really wish I had never bought it and that is so disappointing :(',' negetive'
'I am currently on my second AW110.  I purchased the AW110 2 days prior to going on vacation to Bermuda.  I was expecting to take great photos while snorkeling with this camera.  The camera is rated for underwater use at a depth of 59\', and not to exceed 1 hour.  I snorkeled for 30 minutes, and did not reach a depth greater than 10\' (which is a generous over-estimate).  Upon coming out of the water, the camera would turn on, but the screen would not illuminate.  The screen remained black and is no longer functional.  While the camera has many nice features like integrated Wi-Fi, GPS, and the ability to take 3D pictures, the camera just didn\'t hold up to even 1/6th of the promised depth.  I contacted Nikon Customer Support/Service which was a complete and utter joke.  The representative that I spoke with claimed to be both customer service and technical support; she was neither technically proficient nor friendly.  I was told to send my camera into Nikon at my own expense for it to be evaluated and Nikon would repair it if possible.  If the camera was not repairable, they would \"possibly\" replace it.  I am extremely thankful that I purchased the AW110 from Amazon.com as they just replaced the entire Camera with minimal questions asked, prepaid return shipping, and the postal carrier picked up the package at my front door.  Lastly, I read many reviews before purchasing this camera and this has happened to MANY MANY individuals.  A basic search on the Internet as well as Amazon.com will show an overwhelming community of consumers that have been viciously bitten by this product.  When I mentioned this to the Technical Support Representative, she exclaimed that she had never heard of this issue before... I\'ll leave the readers of this review to generate their own opinion on that note.  If I didn\'t already have a Nikon DSLR prior to purchasing this AW110, I\'d be sure to shop with the 5 - Letter competitor that starts with C and ends with anon.  Furthermore, I urge any representative of Nikon with any level of pride in their organization that may be reading this review to contact me.Update #1: Nikon rejected this very same review on their website for \"One or more reasons\" which are unnamed.  Only positive reviews are allowed. ;)',' negetive'

'Steer clear of this camera. If you are wise you will stay away from this brand of camera also ... their repair service is INCOMPETENT. I purchased this camera on April 19th, 2013. It received light usage for the next couple of months. I always noticed how flaky the screen, focus and white balance were acting from the first turn on of the device ... but it took reasonable pictures, so I ok with it. I then took the camera on vacation, and it started to freeze up on every other picture taken. I would have to remove the battery and reinsert to reboot the camera.I sent the camera in Nikon service. It comes back, \"adjusted and cleaned\" which is code for (I have worked in the electronics business) we did nothing, cause we could find nothing wrong. The device, based on shipping time, was in the service center ONE DAY .. so no one bothered to stress test it.So two weeks ago, same issue. I am taking a couple pictures, and the camera freezes up .. I have to remove the battery to reboot. I send it in again. This time I explained in detail, that I thought based on the problems occurring that the zoom motor may be shorting, which can cause EMF noise and logic circuits to go haywire. After one day the camera comes back again .. We cannot duplicate your problem. its costs me $10 to ship this camera to their service center each time ... Why would I want to do it multiple times? You would think on the second visit, they might expose the camera to more rigorous tests, or replace the camera ... But no ... back it comes with no work whatsoever ...This is my last Nikon product. I hope this review alerts perspective customers. I have a Panasonic camera that is very similar, and it is ROCK SOLID ... Do yourself a favor ... look to another brand of camera!!!',' negetive'
'Have owned nikon cameras since 1984 and have been impressed with their quality and feel as well as picture quality. My oldest nikon still works perfectly. I have a nikon dslr and nikkor lens and again no problems.  Then I bought the \"waterproof\" nikon.  It did well until we went to the Bahamas. Second day of an eight day vacation we went snorkling. Max depth was maybe 10 feet.  Came out of the water and it would not turn on.  Opened battery compartment , wheel was in lock position, inside was water, ruined.  Previous year was used in pool, beach, etc with no problems.  I think that it was just not made well enough for serious water use.  Will not buy again.

'I bought this camera to take on my honeymoon in a few weeks. Having received it and started fooling around with it I will absolutely not keep it after the vacation.At first glance this is a well built camera and I\'m excited to do underwater photography. It has a good depth rating for the money. I\'ll simply break down what I find to be the pluses and minuses.PROS:Well builtGood button layoutImage quality is good. Don\'t have much to compare it to but I like what I\'ve shot so far.It is more than just waterproof. It is also drop proof to 6.6ft. This would be a good camera to take hiking too.CONS:You must remove the battery and charge it externally. Not that big of a deal but when you do this you lose all of your settings. You must set up the camera all over again every time you charge it. Ridiculous.Wireless access is off and greyed-out in the menu. I have no way to activate it apparently. The menu does not mention it whatsoever.This is my second Nikon camera, the other being a mid-range DSLR I bought 4 years ago. It will be my last. Both cameras had strong points but ultimately had such irritating drawbacks that they weren\'t worth owning. It certainly isn\'t a piece of garbage, but unless you need to shoot underwater I would avoid this camera.UPDATE: I ended up returning this camera immediately after returning from the honeymoon that I bought it for. The camera locked up CONSTANTLY which necessitated pulling the battery out. To do so you must break the seal so while it was somewhat possible when we were walking waist deep in the water off the beach (still not a good idea though), it was completely impossible while snorkeling obviously. It nearly ruined my ability to record my honeymoon, and I lost a lot of good images and videos because it would be locked up while snorkeling and I wouldn\'t know it (it is nearly impossible to make out the screen while underwater so you basically just point and click and pray it is recording).',' negetive'

'I have a Nikon D200 dSLR and take thousands of photos.  I wanted to have something more compact for less technical photos and videos and purchased the AW110 with an eye towards using it at zoos, aquariums, parks and on outings where a dSLR is too bulky or intrusive.  While the AW110 is smaller than I\'d expected, it\'s not at all user friendly.  Even attempting to simply use the pre-programmed settings for macro close-ups, \"sports\" action, pets and similar functions failed to achieve the desired results.  More distressing, I would play with settings to get the image to look right on the screen then take a photo and find that the photo looked nothing like what the screen showed.  I would try to compensate to get the look I had seen on the screen and spent 15-20 minutes on a photo that I took & got the right look with one exposure from my iPhone.  Now granted it\'s an iPhone 5, but I really had expected the AW110 to be more effective and useful than an iPhone.  Apparently, this is not the case.  I got so frustrated with this little camera, I was tempted to throw it in the trash.  I went back to the car and got my dSLR and took photos that looked right after a single shot when the AW110 took 5-6 shots to achieve correct exposure.  In addition, the lens constantly fails to focus, then the camera software resets itself wasting time that could be spent shooting.  This was the biggest mistake I have ever made in purchasing photography equipment.',' negetive'
'I would NOT recommend this camera to anyone.  The photo quality, even above water, is not that great (my 5 year old Canon P&S still does a better job) and beyond that the camera stopped working in under 30 days.  We purchased this to go snorkeling on vacation.  Before we even got to the snorkeling location, the battery had died (maybe 20 photos in), and with a fresh battery, the camera wouldn\'t turn on.  I noticed the next day there was condensation behind the screen, and water in the lens area.  The camera had been dunked in water here and there, splashed and whatnot, but not immersed for a long period of time, or anything deeper than 3 feet.I contacted Nikon customer care who told me that the camera wasn\'t powering on because I used an \"unapproved\" SD card (Samsung).  There was NO NOTICE ANYWHERE in the box about using only approved SD cards - nothing in the quick start guide.  It\'s allegedly in the manual (included on CD), but I have NO idea why they wouldn\'t put a warning in the box or on the camera if it\'s that important.  Beyond that, there\'s water in the camera!  Might that be the reason why the camera failed?  I\'m INCREDIBLY disappointed with support.If, for any reason you\'re thinking about buying this camera, don\'t.  Get a regular P&S and a good waterproof bag like an aquapac.',' negetive'
'Wish I had read the warnings others had about this product failing in water. Having used several underwater cameras for years (but never a Nikon) with excellent luck, I figured the technology was pretty well refined at this point. I could not have been more wrong. This camera failed after only a few hours of snorkeling on our recent trip to Hawaii, forcing us to purchase a new camera (a FinePix XP65 which was much cheaper, not rated anywhere near this camera\'s depth, and which after many more days of snorkeling still works!) The failure also prevented us from taking photos during the most beautiful of our snorkeling events (Kapoho Tide Pools). Like many, my screen failed first, and the entire camera failed shortly thereafter. So believe the reviews, there is something wrong with this model; either a design flaw in the model line or severe quality control issues are causing the waterproofing to fail even when the camera is taken no where near the rated depth. Since this product completely fails to function in one of the key areas it is designed to function, it gets a 1 star rating.',' negetive'
'While the specifications and photographic performance of this camera are amazing, the well-reported battery issue still exists, at least on my copy.After researching this camera extensively, I decided to give it a try as most reports of a battery indicator issue were dated from summer to fall of 2013.  A couple of recent reviews indicated that the problem may no longer exist.  I purchased the camera on 2/16/2014 and fully charged the battery before using.  For the first hour or so, I had no issues - frequently cycling between various photo modes and video.  However, then the issues began.  Just like other reviewers have described, the issue is not so much battery life, but the discrepancy of the battery life indication between photo mode and video mode.  The charge indicator can show nearly a full charge in photo mode but when you start recording a video it will drop to below half and turn red.  The camera did turn off on a couple of occasions due to low battery, but when powered up again, the battery indicator showed a healthy charge.Based on about one day of testing I concluded the camera simply could not be trusted and returned it.  This would have been my fourth Canon camera, after enjoyable experiences with an S400, an SD900, and a Rebel T1i.',' negetive'

If you do buy one and it has this problem, return it immediately, don\'t wait until the return period is up, I got stuck with it because I didn\'t test the video until after the return period was over and now I have a sucky camera that cannot be repaired, I believe they have forgotten about all of these and washed their hands of the problem by telling everyone it\'s fixed, check the Canon Forums, nobody has had theirs repaired, thanks Canon I\'ll shop elsewhere.',' negetive'

I asked why these cameras were still being sold with this problem and not being recalled.  no explanation.  so we went to the cannon website and to update the software we have to purchase a SIm card reader cord for 14 dollars.  The cannon representative some how failed to mention this part of the process to us.  If you want days of frustration and spend more money to update your camera by this one.  I am disappointed in amazon and cannon for continuing to send customers this camera.  Both companies know if it has a particular serial number that those cameras have this problem.  We are amazon prime members and will think about this the next time we go to buy something.',' negetive'

'The camera, as far as I am concerned, takes excellent photos in all ranges, including macro.  However, when the camera arrived it sometimes would not power on immediately after turning it off.  The problem worsened over a few days.  Finally I needed to press the power-on button 5 or 10 or 15 times before it would work.  Conversely, power off always worked without a problem.',' negetive'
'I have been using Canon cameras since around 2001 (this is probably the 10th Camera I have owned in the PowerShot series over that time-frame).We purchased this camera specifically for a trip to South Africa since we planned on taking several photos of animals in the wild at far distances, but didn\'t want to bring along something the size of a DSLR. First of all, I must say that the photos that this camera takes are nothing short of spectacular.  The focus is crystal clear for most shots and the zoom is amazing for something that fits in a pocket.  In my opinion, this camera took photos nearly as good as some of the DSLR cameras that other people in our tour group had.  In fact, the owners of those DSLR cameras were shocked by the quality of this camera as well and have asked me to send them some photos of animals that came out blurry on their cameras but came out perfectly on this camera.The optics of this camera are very impressive given the wide range of zoom.  Chromatic aberration is noticeable but not terrible on some images at full zoom.One minor issue is that the flash pops up and is in a very annoying area for most people (where most people place their left hand on the camera).  I personally got used to holding the camera differently to get around the annoyance, but it is still a problem for when we ask someone else to take our photo.Now for the reason I gave this camera one star.This camera suffers from the same issue posted by numerous other reviewers where the camera immediately shuts down due to low battery while attempting to record video and using the zoom feature simultaneously.  This happens even on a full charge (tested with several different batteries including the original).  This is a well documented issue (do a web search for \"canon sx280 battery problems\" and you will see.).  Removing the battery and reinserting it causes the battery meter to show a full charge again and the camera functions just fine until attempting to take video again where the problem repeats itself.Canon claims to have fixed the issue with a firmware patch. I performed the firmware update advised by Canon and verified that the new firmware was correctly installed however as other reviewers can confirm this still did not solve the problem. Note that the firmware update only requires a blank 32MB SD card, not an expensive 32GB SD card that other users have reported (big difference between price of an 32 MB card vs 32 GB).I have a theory that this problem is a design flaw at the hardware level that can not be fixed with software (firmware).  It appears to be a hardware problem not correctable by any firmware updates caused by the battery voltage during times of high power draw (encoding the video plus zooming).  Canon is very aware of the issue and so far has not recalled the camera.  I am not sure why they are trying to sweep this issue under the rug at the expense of their reputation.Some people are reporting that the firmware update fixed the problems.  Maybe that is true for cameras made after a specific date. According to the canon firmware update instructions, this problem affects cameras where the 6th digit of the serial number is lower than 3.  The 6th digit on mine was a 2.So if you have one of these where the 6th digit is a 2 or lower and experience the same problem, then please return it to Canon and don\'t just \"live\" with the problem as I almost did.I ultimately returned the camera and will keep purchasing the same camera and returning it until I am one of the \"lucky ones\" with a 6th digit of a serial number greater than 2 so that I can have a fully working camera with video.',' negetive'
'I was so looking forward to purchasing this camera as I have owned several Canons and this looked to be the best point-and-shoot so far. It had so many good reviews, I was so disappointed to apparently get a lemon.The first day I used it (on a fully charged battery), the battery indicator light started flashing when I used the video. I looked up the problem and found this complaint on one of the Canon forums.  It sounded like a glitch that could be ignored.  But after about a week, not only did the battery indicator flash, the camera would shut down while using video.  It then started shutting down every time I used the zoom to take a photo. I took out the battery, recharged, but the problem only got worse.  It became so I could not even take a photo, and then the camera wouldn\'t even turn on.It\'s been such a frustrating experience and it\'s upsetting to since learn that many other people have had this same problem. I\'ve been a loyal Canon customer, but after this, I\'m reluctant to buy another one of their cameras.',' negetive'
'Update March 11:I mailed my camera to have the firmware updated by Canon. This is as per the technical support. Upon receiving my camera, Canon offered to send to me a refurbished model with all the updates. You can imagine my reaction - as any one else\'s would be.  What!!! Clearly it is a Scam.  I demanded my original brand new one.  I am waiting for Canon to sort out things.BEWARE and don\'t take the route I did.February 23:It is not my first camera but this one is a winner. I love this camera for all the pros that other reviewers noted. I am a mom of 2 under 10 kids and having a camera for me to capture the precious moments in our lives is a MUST. Rating of 4 stars (and not 5) is for the problem that camera is known to cause and the time you need to spend to correct it.My first camera had a problem with battery indicator. As per Cannon technical support, only some cameras have the battery indicator/shutting down problem. Those that are affected are with the serial number listed on the bottom of the camera where the 6th digit from the left is 1 or 2. Well, I requested an exchange from the seller and a brand new camera was sent to me.  I was hoping I would receive a \"problem free\" replacement. However, the second camera has exactly the same problem and the digit is 3.I called Cannon directly since I did not want to deal with self repair - 1800 652 2666. Cannon is willing to repair its xs280 models for free. Don\'t forget to ask for a free shipping label which can be emailed to you. Cannon claims that turnaround time for a repair is 4-5 business days with paid 2 day fedex return.I placed my repair order with Cannon today and am waiting for email with a shipping label to be send.I am really set on keeping this camera so I will go trough the trouble. I bought the camera to capture my kids\' precious moments. The camera works great in the low light settings during kids indoor school performances. My daughter is a swimmer and a gymnast - with the camera and this amazing zoom, for the first time in 8 years I am able to get close up shots of her in action during performances and swim races.',' negetive'
'Sadly we didn\'t purchase our camera on Amazon so we don\'t have the benefit of their return policy! The previously mentioned problems with shooting video make this otherwise fine camera a huge disappointment. Considering all the shinning reviews this camera gets we have to wonder if Canon isn\'t paying people to write this pablum, unfortunately for us we read only those reviews. There are literally tens of thousands of complaints made to Canon and it\'s been posted in every camera forum on the internet.If you are interested in purchasing this camera please consider the following. Shortly after purchase our camera began having the well documented video problems, we were unable to video more than about one minute before camera shutdown (we had the GPS shut off).  After contacting customer support we were instructed to do the firmware update. The support staff commented that this was the first they heard of this problem, apparently they have repeated that lie thousands of times, this too is posted all over the internet. The firmware update did not affect the length of video recording at all, no improvement. The last contact with Canon went unanswered, this too is apparently happening all over.Canon dropped the ball on this and now has abandoned the customer, we won\'t purchase another Canon product.',' negetive'

'I have always used Cannon cameras and I cannot say enough good things about the company. So I bought this recently because of wifi and ability to upload to social media. The camera takes great pictures, the iPhone app works fine, although it uploads only one image at a time. But the browser was the biggest disaster. I installed it on my Mac. The launcher typically has an icon for a software. Cannon has many little apps within one folder I have to find the right icon that would open the browser. The first time I open, it quits. This happens every time I open it. I connect the camera, but do not see an image of my picture. I try to import it, but I cannot. This browser will not import any other picture already on my hard drive either. Needless to say, I have failed to use this camera for uploading photos anywhere. So don\'t buy it if you intend to use the browser. Just so everyone knows, I was reading the pdf manual before installing the browser. I wish Amazon would just take this product back so I can buy something other than cannon. On the Cannon web site the browser has one star from 11 reviewers. So I am not the only one with these views.There is a firmware issue that shows battery low in video mode. I was able to download and address this issue quickly. Not trying to ding Cannon, but the poor quality of browser is just shocking. I cannot believe that the brand I have so respected could let me down so completely.IGNORE WHAT I SAID ABOUT THE FIRMWARE.

'I recently order the Canon Powershot SX280 from Amazon with the intent of using it myself and then if I liked it to give one to my daughter as well.  It was in response to my daughter asking for advice on her next camera. I already owned a Canon SX260 and was completely pleased with it, but wanted WiFi to be able to connect to my iPad and phone.  When it came I charged it up and began to take pictures.  All was well, but when I called my daughter about it, she immediately went on Amazon and read all of the reviews that had a one or two star rating.  She called me back and said that she was concerned that so many of the reviews discussed a flaw in the battery monitoring system that caused the camera to shut down if it was used for video.  I don\'t use video, so I had never tested that mode.  When I switched to video, the SX280 began blinking the battery indicator in red.  If I kept taking video or even switched to still mode the camera would turn off after a few seconds.  It could be reset by powering on again, but if you again went to video mode it would repeat the cycle.I then did a search on Google and found that this problem began being reported almost as soon as Canon put it on the market.  A couple of months later they announced a new firmware load that was supposed to fix it.  Apparently it did not.  I read hundreds of customer complaints that their cameras just could not work if you used the video mode.  I contacted Canon and asked them if they had a fix.  Their reply was that I would have to send them the camera to evaluate the problem.  Most of the customer complaints had said that when they sent their camera to Canon it would be returned with the exact same problem.  I argued with Canon that they must have known about the defect considering the number of complaints, but they just ignored me and said that there was nothing they could do unless I sent them the camera.Clearly the camera is defective.  My guess is that it is a hardware issue and they cannot fix it with firmware upgrades.  Why they would leave it on the market without fixing the camera circuitry is beyond me, but I suspect it is because if they admitted it was a hardware problem, or if they withdrew it from the market before the next model came out they might be subject to a recall situation.I returned the camera to Amazon since it was only 6 days old.',' negetive'
'This camera is defective and there has been no fix for the battery problem related to taking videos.  Some people say that they only use the camera for still photos but that is like saying \"I don\'t need the traction control on my car to work because I don\'t drive in the snow much\". It is defective and Canon knows about it.  Even more despicable is the fact that they do not acknowledge the severity of the problem and that reviewing organizations are not doing their job alerting prospective buyers.  I took mine back months ago after it ruined my video opportunities on an Alaskan bear watch.',' negetive'
'I read the reviews on this camera before buying and knew about the firmware update.  As soon as I got the camera, I upgraded the firmware that is supposed to fix the battery issue.  As soon as I start using video the low battery indicater comes on and the camera shuts down.  Also the video it records is saved as mp4 file which even the canon software does not recognize.  None of my video editing software recognizes the files and you cannot save it any other way.The camera does take good pictures and is quick, but the battery issue kills all the positives for me.  I will be sending the camera back.  Canon should stop selling this camera due to its issues.',' negetive'

'I\'ve just received my second Canon PowerShot SX280 HS.The first one had the old firmware which caused the camera to shut down after a few minutes of use in video mode.I returned the camera to Amazon for an exchange. The new camera also has the old firmware. I called Canon Customer Support. The said to ship it to Canon to flash the new firmware, which would take care of the problem. I asked if I could do this myself. Their reply was \"We do not recommend that.\"I am concerned about Amazon selling me this camera which is defective. This is a known problem, and has been well documented on Amazon. My mistake was thinking that enough time had gone by so that only the new firmware cameras would be in stock.The Canon web page has this posted:How to Identify Cameras that are eligible for the Firmware Update:Please check the serial number on the bottom of the camera.This firmware update is for products with the following serial numbers.Serial numberProducts whose sixth digit from the left is 2 or less[*****2******] , [*****1******] , [*****0******]I now have some accessories that will have to be returned.

'I upgraded to the SX280 HS from the 260 HS because I wanted the DIGIC 6 processor and WiFi.  What a mistake! There is a real problem with the battery life when using the the movie mode. I carry 3 Canon fully charged batteries.  Within approximately 2 minutes after switching to movie mode to record, the battery meter changes from full charge to a flashing red low battery warning. Quickly thereafter, the camera turns off. I turn the camera off then back on and see a full charge state.  However, as soon as I zoom, the flashing red low battery appears and soon shuts itself off if don\'t cycle it off then back on.  I have installed the Canon firmware update but no change in the battery issue.  The still photo mode appears to work without an issue.  Very disheartening and disappointing from Canon.This, in my opinion, would be a fantastic camera if this issue can be corrected.  It has a powerful optical zoom and takes first rate still pictures and videos. Unfortunately, the battery issue makes this Camera impractical unless you carry 3-4 batteries with you all the time and are will to endure this ridiculous process.  Come on Canon, what are you doing?  I wish I still had my 260 HS!',' negetive'
'I want to inform people that I had the same exact issue in movie mode with the battery indicator AFTER the firmware update.  Not only did the red indicator show up seconds after I switched into movie mode, but 2 seconds after the red indicator flashed, the camera SHUT off -- costing me the shot of a lifetime!  I\'m very disappointed that the firmware did not address this issue.  I returned the first camera and was told it had a faulty battery charger (that came with the camera), so I was issued a new camera and charger.  The camera also comes with one battery, so I bought 3 extra batteries and another charger due to the poor battery life (a separate issue from the battery warning in movie mode).  While on vacation, I only used one of the chargers (didn\'t need to charge 2 batteries at a time), but was constantly charging one battery at a time due to the poor battery life.  Even with all of this equipment and the firmware update, I still had problems.  I wouldn\'t have cared if only the red indicator had flashed (and yes, it was a fully charged battery), but the main problem was that the camera shut itself off!!  Sure, the camera took great photos in photo mode but I couldn\'t deal with the battery issue which obviously was not resolved so took the second camera back as well.  It\'s too bad that Canon can\'t get the issue resolved because I would have kept the camera otherwise.  I was even considering getting the older version of this camera, the SX260, but read that it also had a really short battery life (just not the movie mode issue).  I don\'t really want to have to constantly charge batteries so will see if Canon improves the battery life (as well as the battery issue in movie mode) with the next version of the camera, whenever it comes out.',' negetive'

'Both know there is a big problem with this camera relating to making a video but both continue to falsely advertize and then sell this camera. I ordered this camera after being very satisfied with an SX230 and wanted the newer model, was I in for a shock. I received the camera at about 2 PM and by 4 PM I had dropped it off at UPS to return it. Camera does NOT take video. While I use the camera primarly as a camera I do want to make some short 1-3 minute videos when a video tells the story better than a still photo. I put in the battery and it shows being fully charged, take several photos and camera appeared faster than the older SX230 which was one reason for wanting the new model. Switch to video mode and the battery shows almost drained, start taking a video and immediately the battery indicator starts flashing, within a couple of seconds the camera shuts off!!! Turn camera back on, switch to auto photo mode and battery shows full. Try a couple more times with same results so log on to my Amazon account to start the return process. Why both of these once fine companies would continue to not only advertize that this camera can take video and then sell the defective cameras is beyond me. If as Canon has stated there is a \"fix\" by updating the firmware then why don\'t they make sure any cameras being sold have that fix? Why doesn\'t Amazon make sure they get rid of any old inventory of cameras that do not work properly? If in fact the firmware updating does not fix the camera then Canon needs to fess up and say camera does not take video. Amazon is a big company and they should make sure that their vendors are honestly advertizing products. If Amazon does not know how to handle this situation perhaps they should talk with one of the companies they recently aquired, Zappos, about how to go about this. Better for Canon and Amazon to get out ahead on this matter before some enterprising attorney starts a class action. Or maybe some state\'s Attorney General or another governmental agency will take issue with the advertizing claims being made on this camera.',' negetive'

'I bought this camera after reading many positive reviews on professional websites. They all highlighted the camera\'s fantastic picture taking ability, which I completely agree with. However, there is a huge flaw with this camera\'s battery. You will run into many situations where the battery indicator is reading empty but the battery is still fully charged. This would only be a minor inconvenience except that the camera will also shut itself off when it thinks the battery has died (even though you still have a full charge). This makes the camera completely unreliable and will cause you to miss many photo opportunities. I missed several shots on my honeymoon because the camera thought it was dead even though I just charged the battery!If you look hard enough at reviews, you will find this battery problem mentioned by a number of customers. Do yourself a favor and read through this 90+ pages of complaints about the battery issue on Canons website: [...]Please, learn from my mistake and avoid this camera.',' negetive'
'This camera has a major glitch that undermines its otherwise fine features. The battery indicator is misleading about the actual state of charge of the battery, both in still shooting and video. More than once the camera has shut down when the battery indicator showed 2/3 full charge. This has happened after installing the most recent firmware. This glitch effectively significantly shortens the useful life of a battery charge, such that I have found it necessary to carry extra batteries for almost all shooting situations. Even so, I find myself missing shots because the camera begins acting up prematurely. I have contacted Canon and they have dodged my questions about this issue.',' negetive'
'I\'ve owned about 6 Powershots in the past.  This one was out of focus for about half the photos and videos from day one.  I pre-ordered it from Amazon because I wanted to have it for my vacation in Cancun.

I called them to complain, but they told me that that\'s they way they do things.  Also, the used camera has the same serial number sequence that has problems.  But I\'m not supposed to worry because this camera has will have a 3 month warranty.What a rip off.  To top it off, the camera is $100 cheaper now, just a few months later.',' negetive'

Argh.Gotta find something different!Great lens & features otherwise... but after 2 months... with this much dust... this is a deal killer... and NOT ACCEPTABLE.BTW...

'Canon should be ashamed for selling this product which can\'t record video as described.  Read the reviews on Canon\'s own website regarding this camera.  Even after doing the firmware update as recommended it still doesn\'t operate.  When attempting to record a video, the low battery light flashes, even with a fully charged battery.  After 20 seconds of recording it shuts down and a message comes up to recharge the battery.I contacted Canon support and was told that a camera that has a serial number with the sixth digit being 2 or below requires the firmware update and that should correct the problem. My firmware update was done correctly and I\'m sure the reviews of the others that did updates are also correct.  IT DOESN\'T CORRECT THE PROBLEM.  The tech support agent couldn\'t explain except that it must be an internal problem in the camera and I could either send it in for repair or try and and exchange it for a new camera.  I have had the camera for just over one week and it has only caused frustration.  CANNON, PLEASE READ THE REVIEWS ON YOUR OWN WEBSITE.

'I bought this camera a month ago, and was just checking about returning it and missed the deadline to return it without $$$ penalty by one day.  That sucks and so does this camera.  The zoom is great and it takes nice photos once it decides to focus.  So if you want to spend $300 for a camera that takes nice pictures go for it.  There is a lot of other camera at half that price that take great pictures thou.  If you want to take movies with this camera forget it!  They come out nice, BUT, you have like 3 minutes of battery life before it dies when you use the video function.  I bought an extra battery with this and it doesnt matter which one I use or which charger I use, they both die within 5 minutes of using the video function.  Huge flaw in this product.  I can\'t believe it. Its BS.  I\'ve had 4 canon powershots before, and not a single one ever had battery life issues. Its not highly unlikely I will buy another Canon. I\'m also mad at Amazon wanting to penalize my refund because of one day.  That\'s BS.  I ordered the camera before I actually needed it.  How was I supposed to know the battery life while making videos was going to be so horrible?  I DO NOT RECOMMEND YOU BUY THIS CAMERA.  Its not worth the price.',' negetive'
'Canon marketing or engineering made some odd choices in this 20x travel zoom.  It competes with the Panasonic ZS30, Nikon S9200 and the Sony HX50.Pros.- The 12 MP sensor and lens combination is clear and sharp with snappy colors.- The digital zoom has fewer artifacts than the competition.Cons.- The camera tends to overexpose and blow out highlights.  It doesn\'t offer automatic exposure bracketing which might avoid this problem (and will one day be available with the CHDK firmware mods).- No travel 20x zoom lens is going to offer wide apertures but this lens has a narrowest aperture of f/8.  If you attempt to shoot a longer shutter and narrow aperture to increase your depth of field or blur water or action, the camera will blow out the scene.- The initial battery indicator bug in video appears to have been fixed, but when the 4GB file size limit is reached, this camera stops recording.  If you notice this, you can push the video button and record another 25 min segment.  But there will always be a gap.  Every dash dvd avoids this as do the competition, but not Canon.- No sweep panorama option available on the competition and most cellphones.- The WiFi does not have remote control like the competition.- Focus and exposure is restricted to the center of the image unless the camera detects a face.- ISO is automatic restricted to 80 on long shutter speed shots.  So if you shot in low light like a club show, the Canon makes it even more difficult to hand hold a useable shot.Overall, this could have been a much better camera with much better software.  Canon made some choices which seriously detracts from the usefulness of this camera.',' negetive'
'If you are buying this camera for movie mode then don\'t waste your money. There is a major fault with the battery level indicator when in video mode. The battery indicator will appear and the camera will shut off in video/movie mode but if you eject the battery and start again in photo mode then the battery will show full or near full charge. Canon tried to fix this issue with an updated firmware however I tried this and it did not fix the problem. I would definitely not suggest this camera for anyone interested in video / movies.',' negetive'

Very disappointing...',' negetive'
'I usually buy all of my cameras ( Canon and Panny addict here) through Amazon, and have not returned a single one out of the dozen or so purchased over the years. I wished I had done so with my current SX280, for I would have been able to return it and be done with this spawn of Satan.The features and pictures, design and build of the camera are fantastic. Lens is sharp. So what sucks?The video. If you\'ve read any three reviews in a row here, you\'ll have noticed that the camera shuts down once the zoom button is engaged. The blinking red weak battery icon becomes ever present, and once the zoom button is touched, the camera shuts down after 30 seconds. BTW,  I purchased mine in November 2013, and it had one of the dreaded serial numbers.So I downloaded the firmware and upgraded. Did absolutely nothing.Then I called Canon. They were gracious and had me send the camera in free of charge as it is still under warranty. I got it back very quickly- within 2 weeks, along with a nice note explaining the problems with the camera and how they fixed it.Only they didn\'t. Same issues. Same red blinking light when the Record button is pushed. Same shut down- but now 5 minutes instead of 30 seconds later- unless you try it twice, and then it shuts down after 30 seconds. Really, Canon? Technicians?So this is why I\'ve taken the time to write a review. Another reviewer mentioned that Canon was not repairing the SX280,, but replacing them with refurbs.  My guess is that so many have been returned they ran out of replacements and just send the camera back hoping you\'ll go away.  Well. I\'m telling you- if you get this camera, put it into video mode with a fully charged battery and a class 10 SD card, and hit Record.  Let it go and see if the red battery icon appears, and also zoom in and out. Leave it recording for another minute, and move the zoom button to the right. If it doesn\'t shut down, I guess you\'re ok. Otherwise, you know you have a lemon.Update: I\'ve contacted Canon again, and they are taking the camera in again to see what\'s up. I will update, as that would be the fair thing to do.2nd Update 3/14/14....Canon sent a refurbished model....that didn\'t work either. Can you believe it? A refurbished model with the dreaded serial #2 in the sixth number from the left. When I called again and finally got to a supervisor, he wanted me to send the camera back \"for another try\". I kid you not.. The response was so dry and indifferent that I insisted on a new camera this time.. I have two choices, he said. Send it back or wait to have a Canon Corporate Rep call me. \"How long will that be?\"  They will call you by later this afternoon. That was 2 days ago.I envy all of you folks who bought the camera with no problems. I would love to be one of you. But really- to send in a new camera- have them send it back as repaired when it is not- send it back again, and get a refurb that is broken as well-and then just say send it back again... I wished I had never had to find out how ineptly and indifferently the Canon service department operates.',' negetive'
'I\'m so disappointed.  I read all of the reviews about the battery life issue before purchasing this camera.  On Canon\'s website, they say if you have a serial number that has 3 or higher, you don\'t need the firmware upgrade that supposedly fixed the low battery life issue.  So, mine has a 3 in the serial number and I thought it would be okay.  WRONG!  They are STILL defective.  Shame on Canon for selling such a lemon.  The battery problem occurs intermittently whenever using the zoom at all even in photo mode.  Whenever I try and zoom, it shuts down and says \"charge battery.\"  You can turn it back on and you will have a full battery, but if you try and zoom with photo OR video, it immediately shuts down.  I\'m returning it to Best Buy where I also purchased the 1 year service agreement.  The battery went dead anyway after shooting about 25 pictures.  SERIOUS defects!',' negetive'
'[YET ANOTHER UPDATE: I\'ve downgraded my review from two stars to one. Why? Because I tried to offload the photos from a long trip to my computer, and kept getting \"communication error\". I thought the camera was broken. Some internet search indicates that YOU CANNOT OFFLOAD ANYTHING IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN 1000 PHOTOS ON THE CARD. It says you should use an external USB reader, which of course is not included in the package. Is Canon for real here? In this day and age, with 32GB cards selling for very little, 1000 photos isn\'t a lot. Merely telling people \"communication error\" is a nutty way to get this across, instead of \"Too many photos to offload\", or something actually useful.]Let me say that this is my fifth Canon camera, and I have always found their products to be a good mix of usability, features, and price points. The 260 came highly recommended and, when the its successor, the 280, came available, I figured it was time to upgrade my prior Canon. This was actually in lieu of the Sony RX-100, a spectacular camera that unfortunately only has a 3.6x zoom.The 280 takes very good, often great, photos, and the zoom is sometimes astonishing in its ability to pick out fine detail in what seem to be impossibly distant subjects.But this camera should not be sold, and it\'s utterly shameful for Canon to still be doing so. IT IS INHERENTLY DEFECTIVE, and they know it (or, at least, there is no plausible deniability here, given the dozens of comments on their own site and on Amazon about the same issue). There are two issues, actually: battery life, which is bad (but tolerable), and the fact that the battery INDICATOR is preposterously inaccurate. You can put in a freshly charged battery, the indicator will SAY it is charged, then, in just 5 minutes, it will flash red, saying the battery is about to die. If you turn it on and off, it will then say it\'s fully charged.If you think this is merely an annoyance, think again: it will actually stop your video right in the middle. It got to the point where it was stopping the video every three seconds.The camera, in my view, is therefore unusable, and Canon is knowingly selling a defective product. A class action should be brought against them, and Big Box stores like Best Buy and even Amazon, if they had any sort of integrity, should inform Canon that they will not carry this product any longer. It is sad that Amazon and others will suffer a slew of returns for selling this, but IN NO WAY should you even considering purchasing this.And, yes, I did the firmware update. It makes the problem somewhat better, but it hardly goes away.[Unfortunately, I took this to Europe for a long trip as my only camera, and cannot easily exchange it from here. Also unfortunately, I was a something of a Canon loyalist, but this is really beyond the pale. It\'s the last time I will even consider a product of theirs. This is not accidental, and they should recall every one of these at their own expense until they can produce something that is NOT OBVIOUSLY SERIOUSLY DEFECTIVE. Sorry for the caps, but I did want to make it clear that, if you are still considering this: Don\'t.]UPDATE BELOW:I may have overstated my case; I\'ve been using the camera intensively for an additional week, and the quality of still photos has been often exceptional, especially using the zoom.The point of my review was to alert potential purchasers to the issue with the video\'s simply stopping in the middle of shooting. This has now happened to me three more times just in the last week. It\'s real; it keeps happening; and I, too, did the firmware update.I would also say that I\'ve been carrying two batteries with me every day, and have had to use both every day. This did NOT happen with prior Canon cameras, and those used smaller batteries, so this is an especial battery hog. Let me be clear that I, personally, don\'t really care about that. What I DO care about -- and what I feel I made abundantly clear in the review -- are: (1) that the camera keeps needing to be restarted just to get the battery indicator to read accurately, which is merely annoying; and (2) that videos will often shut down in the middle, even with a mostly charged battery. This has now occurred MANY times, and it\'s hard to see how this won\'t be a dealbreaker for many potential purchasers.I suppose that, in the end, it comes down to whether one is hoping to use the camera nearly exclusively for still photos. If so, it\'s an excellent, if flawed, camera. If not, and video performance is important, I stand fully behind what I said at the end: do not even consider it.',' negetive'

'Very disappointed with Canon. I bought mine at Best Buy and had the same issue with the poor battery life, this was even after the firmware \"update\". This is wrong to continue selling a camera that they know has issues, now I know why it was sold at such a discount. It makes you wonder how poor Canons testing is to overlook this huge flaw. I was also not happy with the image quality, I took shots side by side in auto with my five year old Canon SD790 IS and it was much better. In the end I took it back and got the Sony HX50V...it was more expensive but it beats the Canon in every way. The battery life is excellent, I can actually record video and take pictures and go back to recording, and the image quality is better.

'I\'ve purchased two of these cameras in the last year and I\'ve had the same problem with both of them.  1) the zoom lens is very sensitive, if you get any dust or dirt in the lens area the zoom locks up.  2)  the input for the charger is very sensitive and the metal prongs get bent very easily and then you will not be able to charge the camera or connect the camera to a PC.  I bought two of these cameras as I thought it was just myself having user error which caused the problems, this is not true, after I bought the second one I was super careful to handle the camera with extra care and I ran into the same problems again.

'This is my second Lumix after having Canons.  I had a ZS3 with 12X optical zoom.  I absolutely loved that camera (a friend dropped it).  I took a picture once on full zoom out of a plane window of a ship in the water below at least 2 miles away.  It was just a speck in the distance.  I then magnified the image on the camera\'s screen and I could see the color of the ship, how many stacks it had, etc.  It was simply amazing.  Well, I bought this thinking that the 20X zoom would be even better.  It was not, and actually it is nowhere close to the ZS3.  There is something wrong with the focus.  When you zoom on the screen the picture is fuzzy.  I took the same picture with the Z20 and an older Canon. The old Cannon looked much better. This camera may be too technically ambitious.  It has some nice features but they went way over the top and made a mess in the process.I also went to Costco and checked out the Z19 -- it seemed to be better, although I had to take a picture in the store and I didn\'t have a direct comparison.I read some other reviews here saying that someone else had the same problem and that Panasonic was updating the firmware.  But I called Panasonic twice and they have no firmware update planned and the reps said they know of no such problem. The firmware on the camera is version 1.0.  I told them about the reviews on Amazon and they clearly didn\'t want to know anything about it.I can\'t live with fuzzy pictures so this camera is going back to Amazon.  Buyer beware.UPDATE----I have since gone back to Costco to check out the zs-19 and looked at it more carefully.  The fuzziness was no better than the ZS-20.  So I ended up replacing my original ZS-3 with a factory refurbished unit I found online.  It will get me through until Panasonic fixes their issues.  What was also interesting was that several sources online sell the ZS-3 new for $4-500 even though it\'s an old model. The lens was really great on the ZS3.  The later ZS models use some lens tricks to try and get the same results using less lens -- this could be an issue.',' negetive'
'I received this camera for Christmas from my husband. In most of the several dozen pictures we took there was a faint shadow in the bottom corner of the pictures (slight but undeniably noticeable). It appears that this is either a design flaw or this particular camera was a lemon. It\'s a somewhat bulky camera in contrast to my older, much more compact Canon Elph I purchased in 2009. Also, unlike that camera, the screen resolution was surprisingly poor. An hour glass even popped up while it delayed processing, which reminded me of the digital camera I bought 8 years ago. I think technology should keep improving in all aspects of the camera, so it felt like a regression using this. Overall, a disappointment.',' negetive'

'Rec\'d ZS20  today. Overjoyed! Had spent a LOT of time considering what pocket camera would be best to complement my SLR-and-too-many-lenses-etc kit.  Used it for 10 minutes.  Handed it to wife.  She says zoom doesn\'t work. She\'s right. Suddenly, no control works, not even the off switch; camera is entirely locked up.No support phone number in the manual so search for it on the Web. I have spent the last two and a half hours trying to reach customer support at Panasonic. I have gone into limbo; been disconnected; had the line answered by an operator 3 times; been answered by one other person who said she is transferring me to the correct agent (that line has been on hold for 32 minutes at this point); etc, etc; been asked to enter full model number omitting no letters or numbers, a challenge when calling on a Blackberry, etc, etc; .  Operator has told me that all the problems are  to a system upgrade.  (What was it like before the upgrade? <joke>  More seriously, what kind of idiot puts in upgrades to mission critical contact center software during business hours?)So I have fully lit up but dead camera; on/off doesn\'t even work. It is zoomed and I need to figure out how to unzoom it (zoom switch doesn\'t work) so I can fit it into the box and in utter frustration and disappointment return it to Amazon.And now, 37 minutes into my call being on hold I get an agent who tells me that there is no reason this should have happened; he can\'t explain it.  I ask for a return authorization.  He says they\'ll have it picked up for repair. I say \'unacceptable\'.  He says he will transfer me to 2nd level support. Instead, he transfers me back to the beginning--and \"the voice\" asks me why I am calling.  I tell it \"technical support\" and it says \"sorry--we are now closed.\"The hell with Panasonic. I am really disappointed - bought this for a trip to the Caymans next week.  It is going back to Amazon tomorrow.PS - another trio of Panasonic \"joy killers\" (not misrepresentations or anything, just things that may impact the quality of your experience as a consumer):(1) No card ships with camera.(2) Battery does not come charged, so when you get excited as you get it out of the box you have to wait 4.3 hours for a charge before you can play with your new camera.(3) Manual is provided on CD only (unless you count all 18 pages of instructions in the \"Basic Owner\'s Manual\").Boy, does the excitement fade quickly.UPDATE.  Last night I finally sent them an email saying that it was impossible to call them and I had spent 2 hours trying; would they be so kind as to call me.  They replied this morning (12 hour turnaround, not bad for email help request) but they said \"please call us for assistance\".  I replied \"Please call me; I was too frustrated by my experience to try to call you guys.\"FURTHER UPDATE.  2 days later, no reply.  I have a return authorisation from Amazon.  Camera has behaved and not locked up again.  Not sure what I am going to do.UPDATE.  Got the replacement; no problems.  Like the camera very much but no desire to change the rating.FURTHER.  Bought a new laptop and have found that PhotoFunStudio - the utility Panasonic provides to transfer pictures from the camera to a PC does not work unless you have the font size set, in Windows, to 100\%.  The laptop has a great high res screen and I have it set to 150\% font size in order to get things readable. Panasonic support recommends that whenever I want to transfer photos I change to 100\%, which means I  must then log off [closing all programs on your desktop] and log back in.  This is dark ages programming - pure laziness and stupidity on Panasonic\'s part. I then need to reverse the process when I am done with PhotoFUstudio.  Can I change my review down to a half star?',' negetive'
'This camera takes good pictures but there are more issues other than that. When I try to switch from camera to the view the picture there is a 1-2 minute wait. then when I want to go back to picture taking mode another 2 minute wait. I miss a lot that way.That is to long to wait for it to switch. The GPS is very hard to get calabrated, hard to findsatelites. The date stamping is very slow. I was in Israel and took around 50 pictures one day, I wanted to date stamp them so I set it up to do that. Date stamping takes a long time for that many pictures, so I just got it started and went to bed leftit plugged in to the outlet so so all night it worked and by morning it was still not finished and I had o turn it off because I needed the camera for that day. I lost about 50\% of my pictures. After that as I resumed the use of the camera the problem started with it locking and as described earlier it was very slow in switching from picture to camera mode. I sent it back to MC Allen Tx for repair it was under warranty and they told me nothing was wrong with it. it came back to me and I continued the use of it and it got worse. I decided to just pay for the repair if they would fix it. I sent it back to them, they wante dmy CC and told me it would cost 178.00 to fix. I agreed to do it. 2 weeks later I called and they, they told me that still there is nothing wrong with it but they would have to charge me to inspect it.

I took very good care of this camera, always kept it in a case, never dropped it, etc. No abuse, no misuse, just normal usage for a point and shoot camera.

Less then a year after I bought this camera I noticed a spot. Since I just got the camera I checked into my warranty but they wouldn\'t help me and to clean it would cost more then buying a new camera. Very disappointed. I love this camera but can\'t afford to buy a new one every year. Looking into Canon',' negetive'
'I spent a lot of time looking for a camera with a good zoom capability for my trip to the U.K.  I knew there would be lots of photos I would have to take from a distance, and I wanted a clear result.  I also needed a camera that would allow me to take clear pictures with no flash, since we would be in many historical castles, museums, etc.  Long story short- the FIRST DAY of the trip we go to the Tower of London, I turn on camera to zoom in on a shoot, and it freezes on me! I can\'t get the camera to do anything. The zoom lenses is stuck in the out position, and the screen says there\'s an error. Totally useless camera on a 16 day trip of a lifetime!',' negetive'
'Just received this camera today from Amazon.  4 hours to charge the battery,that\'s OK,but then took a test photo.  First picture and I get the message that the internal memory is full.  What\'s up with that?  I have to purchase a memory card to take more than one picture?  I am NOT happy. I will buy the memory card, but nowhere on Amazon do they tell you that the internal memory on this camera is zilch and that your need an external card.  Seems to be a nice camera but how can you be sure if the internal memory is only ONE photo?',' negetive'
'I picked this camera up from Best Buy last week.  I was replacing an older Canon and heard nothing but good things about the Panasonic Lumix.  I went out and bought 2 class 6 cards.  I soon found out the processor on this camera sucks.  It was much slower than expected.  I was hoping to point, click, and shoot. Instead it\'s point, click, wait, wait, wait....., shoot.  I\'ve played with all of the settings and swapped cards out.  it\'s still slow.  oh well.  I\'ll return and take a look at the new Canon cameras.',' negetive'

'Camera is great when it works.  Read all the one star reviews before purchasing. These are the real reviews you need to see because something will go wrong and all you can expect is the worst customer service in the world.  The customer service is just horrible.  Not only do they not honor the repairs, they are rude and snide.The Leica zoom lens gets dust inside that you can\'t get to.  It will show up in your pictures as dark grey spots or lines.  This is a known issue and Panasonic will leave you high and dry.  I sent my camera back twice under warranty.  Within a few weeks of the last repair, the dust was back.  The camera was now out of warranty and they wanted $180 to fix it.Why would I pay $180 for them to fix something they fixed three weeks before for free and it didn\'t last.Read reviews on other sites like CNET.com and you will find the same issues with the camera and the same complaints about the customer service.  Panasonic knows there is a problem with dust and still sells the camera without backing up the product.This is my second Panasonic Lumix camera.  The first lasted just over one year.  I was in a hurry to replace it before a trip and since I was familiar with it, I bought another but newer model.  Never again.  If the camera is working, the pictures are great only if you have great lighting, however, you will be very disappointed in low light settings.  The video is jumpy if you are filming something that is moving fast.  Do not waste your money. Buy a camera that will last more than a year and lives up to the warranty and backs their repairs.',' negetive'

I wanted something that had a good zoom but, more pocket size.The bottom line is that I\'ve taken several pictures in natural ligth and with the flash, indoor, outdoor, cloudy, sunny etc. on the IA setting and the pictues are just horrible.  There is no other way to put it.  I tried a different memory card just to see if that might be an issue but, it is the camera.

'I purchased this camera for my mother in law and have spent hours trying to figure out why it can\'t / won\'t download pictures to the computer.  She has a new computer with Windows 7.  You can\'t take the SD card out and put into your computer to copy.  You have to hook up the camera to the computer then you have to use the PHOTOfunSTUDIO software which comes with the camera and is not fun at all.  Then you have to download the software that allows your computer to recognize SDHX cards.  Then you have to spend hours getting nowhere.  I don\'t know why this doesn\'t easily download pictures to the computer.  I have a panasonic lumix myself and had one before no problem at all.  Love them.  But this new really hard to use software and SDHX card I do not recommend.

I guess the camera has a great optical zoom but the chance for it to fail is much higher than other cameras. So be careful, buyers. You have high chance to end up using it just for a year and may cost you $150 to repair and put you in a dilemma whether to repair it or buy a new one.',' negetive'

'I have had this camera for a little more than a year.  I bought it to replace an earlier model with fewer features.  I liked that one a lot, but sand got into the lens after a trip to FL.  On reading various reviews of the Lumixes, I now know that dust/sand in the lens is a common problem with a lot of the Lumix line.I used this new camera a few timed before heading to Hawaii.  Photos there varied wildly in color, often not at all resembling the true color of what I was shooting.  Then the camera started going off randomly.  I got some great pix of the floor of the car, for example.  The answer, which I learned later, was to reset the camera.  I have done so.  Many times, in fact.  This random shooting crops up frequently, resulting in wasted time and disk space.Recently, I found the color to differ wildly from the top of a picture to the bottom,  That problem was solved when my son-in-law noticed that my finger, as I held the camera, partially covered the flash.  User goof, but-- badly placed flash as well.  I now have to hold the camera at the top and bottom with 4 fingers, which does not feel stable to me.It was out of warrantee when I got totally frustrated...',' negetive'

'I specifically purchased this camera for an extended backpacking trip due to its wide zoom and light weight.  It took good pictures while it worked but after 4 months the display failed.  I have read that this is not unusual with the camera so I sent it in for warranty repair.  I was then advised that there was corrosion found inside the camera and the warranty would be voided as a result.  While it was a very wet early season the camera was not exposed to rain other than an occasional light drizzle.  It was kept in a water resistant case but it was by my side in humid weather as were my other electronic devices such as my cell phone which was probably exposed to more rain but had no issues.  Whether the display failure was related to the corrosion is up for debate.  What is not is that the camera will experience corrosion if kept in humid outdoor conditions for an extended period of time and this will void the warranty.  The camera is not recommended for extended field use.',' negetive'
'I got a Panasonic camera last year for Christmas, and I just wanted to warn everyone about my terrible customer service experience.  I was very happy with how such nice optics fit in such a small package.  A few weeks ago, I noticed that the flash wasn\'t working and the mode indicator dial wouldn\'t always register the correct position.  Since the camera was still under warranty, I sent it in for repairs.I got a call from Panasonic a week later telling me that the warranty was void because of a small dent on the camera\'s mode indicator dial, and since the dent was in one of my problem areas, they claimed the warranty was void.  There was no dent when I sent the camera in for repairs.Panasonic said that it is their policy to keep the packaging of any package which looks like it was damaged in shipping.  They did not keep the packaging for my camera, since it had shown no signs of damage.  I talked to a number of people at the post office, and they also had no record of damage.  The only logical conclusion left was that the camera was damaged at Panasonic\'s repair facility.Panasonic, of course, insists they do not damage cameras, and that it is not possible for a camera to be even accidentally damaged at their facility.  They told me several times they would have a manager call me back to speak to me about the situation.  No one ever did.  Every time I called again, I was told the manager was unavailable.  I got no help from anyone at their support center.  I only got brushed off.My camera had no dent when I sent it in.  It was sitting untouched on a table between the last time I used it and the time I noticed it was malfunctioning.  Panasonic treated my camera negligently at their facility. Now they want to charge me more than the cost of the camera to have it repaired, when it should still be under warranty.Panasonic sold me an unreliable product, damaged it further instead of repairing it, and gave me terrible customer service.  I will never buy any product or service from them again, and I encourage you to avoid them as well.',' negetive'
'I just finished packaging up the camera to send it back to Panasonic for warranty work.  I read some other reviews stating this camera was susceptible to getting dust inside the lens but I disregarded them.  I wish I hadn\'t.I now have some dirt inside my lens that shows up as a dark oval shaped distortion in the lower LH corner of the view finder as well as in all the pictures.  Apparently dirt can get inside the lens if you use the zoom frequently.  Anyway, I guess I will get to post a review of the warranty service too later on.When it was clean it took good pictures and excellent video but it\'s useless to me now.EDIT:The camera was received at the Panasonic facility on 6/14/2013.  I did not receive the camera back until 7/10/2013.  The warranty claim process was slow and the communication to me throughout the process was non-existent.Any to the commenter:  Yes I give the camera 1 star now.  It\'s useless if it will get dirt in the lens with just mild easy use.  Coincidentally, just today my neighbor asked me to take a picture of her and her son on their bikes and it was almost the same camera that she had me use.  Same basic design but an older model with 16x zoom.  That one had tons of crap inside the lens or on the sensor too...it was horrible.  I will surely never buy a Panasonic camera again knowing that they have this design defect and it has not been fixed even though the older models were this way too.',' negetive'

Whitewashed faces, obnoxious shadows from the flash, yellow flesh tones, and blurred pictures. I didn\'t try it outdoors, but what\'s the point - I need a good all-arounder.

The next time I tried to use the camera, the inside of the camera looked like broken glass.  There is no evidence of damage or mishandling on the outside of the camera whatsoever.

They sent me back an e-mail for repair that would cost 363.88!!!  I purchased the camera from Amazon on April 2nd for 286.00 which included tax and shipping.  When I called to complain, they said that the numbers were wrong and that the actual cost would be around 180.00 (WOW!!)

'Panasonic has a quality issue with these cameras.  I ordered one after seeing a good overall review score.  I had hoped to get a good unit.  The first unit came and no matter what I did I could not get a nice clear picture.  I tried all kinds of settings as suggested in different reviews here.  So I gave up and set it back for a replacement.  When the replacement showed I took a quick set of pictures.  Low and behold the first shot was much cleaner.  I was happy... but... only the first shot.  Once again it took all lousy pictures.  I even took it to a family member who has a DSLR and knows all the proper setting for lighting and such.  He could not get this second unit to take a clear picture.  So... on last chance.  My wife purchased a Fuji Film camera (dont have model # handy) and I took side by side shots of them both in Auto mode.  What a difference... the Fuji was taking pictures as I would expect a $300 camera to take.  There was no comparison.  I would avoid the Panasonic unless you like to keep sending them back until you get a good one.  I wanted to love it... but hated it.',' negetive'
'Bought the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS20 camera from Amazon about a year ago.  At first it seemed okay overall, though I noticed a slight problem with oranges appearing yellow in pictures of sunsets. Then in July 2012 I went on a trip to the upper peninsula of Michigan where I took hundreds of pictures outdoors.  After a couple of hundred pictures a dark brown spot started to appear in the middle of the left side of every new image taken. Now there is a large blurry area in the upper right of every new image as well. So the camera has become useless. I am especially disappointed because I had a Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS1 for a couple of years and it always worked great. When I lost the ZS1 in May 2012 I thought I would try another Lumix, but I regret it now.  I cannot recommend the ZS20, though I would still recommend the ZS1. In the end the ZS20 cost about $1.50 for each of the approximately 200 good images I obtained while using it. From my experience, the ZS20 is a waste of time and of money!',' negetive'

'I should have looked at this cameras features before I bought it. I don\'t buy a camera that does not have some form of optical image stabilization. This camera has a cheap form of image stabilization which is near useless! The camera takes three shots and combines them for a \"blur free\" picture. I went out on a sunny day and snapped dozens of photos using this feature and NOT ONE was sharp or clear. But I wanted to give this camera a decent try before posting a review telling other people to look elsewhere for a camera,don\'t buy this one! I went out and used no zoom no digital zoom just a standard wide angle on a sunny day. For a 16mp camera these photos were grainy like 1600 Asa film. This camera fails big time in all areas.

Photos from the easyshare Z1085IS which is only 10mp looks a hundred times sharper than this camera. I don\'t recommend camera.

As other reviewers have noted; the focus is very soft and the flash takes forever to recharge.I would have rated it 3 stars, however, I also suspect that the camera (Sold on Amazon by Tri State Camera) was an \"Open Box\" item, as it was not sealed and did not come with a warranty card.',' negetive'

'I\'ve owned 2 previous Canon Powershots, both Elph versions, and I loved them. My last one stopped working last summer so I purchased this camera based on the Amazon reviews. It takes FOREVER to get the shot because the minute you try to snap the shot, it says \"flash charging\". I miss the picture practically every time. While I do have a Nikon DSLR, which is hands down my favorite camera, it\'s not practical to carry around with me. I love having a point & shoot to just throw in my purse. I will definitely spend a little more $$ and do a little more research before buying my next one.',' negetive'
'Does not include USB cable. Does not include AV out cables. Both of these were included with previous versions of the PowerShot Axxx line of cameras.Does not include memory card, not even a small starter card.I have liked Canon cameras from the past days, but this is getting ridiculous. Give people enough to get started and to use their photos.Not including the memory card I kind of get. But no cable is ridiculous.',' negetive'
'buy a camera except camera parts not included. And so far have not been able to return for a refund',' negetive'
